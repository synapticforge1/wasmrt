# interop.md — the **wasmrt ⇄ wazmrt swappability contract**

**CONTRACT VERSION: 33 — wazmrt LEADS (owner, 2026-08-19).** 🔒 **v33 (2026-10-23): (1) RELEASE LOCKSTEP ENDED (owner: "we are officially out of lock step now due to differences"), §1e; the contract rows and the mirror stay. (2) v32 covers MEANINGS as well as names (owner: "aligning with binaryang means its meanings also"). (3) wasmrt's two annexes §2.2f / §2.2m are FOLDED, and the copies were byte-identical at the fold** ⏳ PENDING MIRROR. 🔒 **v32 (2026-10-23): the owner REVERSES v30's direction: `--features` aligns with binaryang's D2 vocabulary, not wasm-tools'** (§2.2's row; record-only until binaryang's FL1 settles the spellings) ⏳ PENDING MIRROR. 🆕 **v31 (2026-10-23): wasmrt's commit ids are its post-rewrite ids** (workspace letter H21; no row's meaning changes) ⏳ PENDING MIRROR. 🆕 **v30 (2026-09-21): `--features` takes wasm-tools' whole vocabulary with wasm-tools' meanings, proven identical by one shared measurement matrix** (§2.2). 🚨 **v29 (2026-09-21): `.wat` pin portability is BROKEN on purpose** — wazmrt `1.0.2` fixed letter H13's three encoder divergences from wasm-tools, and pins now agree with wasmrt on 64/528 until wasmrt makes the same fixes (§3.1). 🆕 **v28 (2026-09-21): §5 #12 CLOSED by amending §2.4a to match the code** (exact wazmrt flag names after the first guest word are an error; only `--` hands off unconditionally), **and wazmrt `1.0.2` ships before wasmrt reaches `1.0.1`** (§1e revised). 🆕 **v27 (2026-09-21) CLOSES §5 #10 by giving the `--dir` host half a GRAMMAR** — a relative path must say `./` or `../`, which makes a leading `<letter>:` a drive by grammar instead of by resemblance, so the heuristic v14 forbade is deleted rather than exchanged. 🚨 **It also fixes a defect the row never suspected: the drive rule had no platform branch and was shipping to Linux and macOS.** ⚠️ **wazmrt is now the stricter side of a CLI row for the first time — so this one needs a mirror in the other direction.** The wasmrt half is **UNMEASURED**; the check is written into the §2.2 row. wazmrt is finishing its hardening stage and **its copy is the latest**; wasmrt mirrors from it and **does not originate version numbers** until wasmrt reaches the same stage. ✅ **THE 2026-09-19 OWNER DECISIONS ARE FOLDED IN AND NUMBERED HERE** — **§2.4a as v11**, **§2.5 as v12**, wasmrt's **§2.3m annex as v13** (the §2.3 Z1 row, and row 3 promoted to ✅ AGREED), 🔒 **the owner's NO-"LOOKS LIKE" clarification as v14 (§2.4a-i)**, and 🔒 **the owner's same-day NARROWING of §2.4a as v15** (after the module path a single-dash token is the guest's). ⚠️ **v14 puts §2.2's `--dir` drive-letter fallback in tension and needs an owner ruling (§5 #10).** 🆕 **v16 adds §2.4b: a flag with a REQUIRED position, written where it cannot apply, is an error** — and wazmrt has **shipped** it. 🆕 **v17–v20 fold in wasmrt's T9e + T9i (2026-09-19):** **v17** Z4, `.wat` pin digests are not portable and the cause is the `name` section · **v18** the pin DB path is DECIDED (§3.3), closing §5 #1 · **v19** §3.7a is CLOSED, verified by running both, closing §5 #5 · **v20** §2.1/§2.2 convergence — wasmrt's column is green and wazmrt's halves are what remain. ⚠️⚠️ **v20 also carries a NEW wazmrt defect this pass found by running: `--dir .:/` — the example wazmrt's own `--help` prints — DOES NOT WORK**, and the cause is the drive-letter heuristic already flagged at §5 #10. 🚨 **v15 exists because §1c happened again while this very pass was running** — both sessions edited their own copies within the same hour; see the v15 change-log row. 📎 **The annexes themselves (§2.1m, §2.3m) stay where they are** — they are the measured *evidence*, and folding never means deleting the measurement that bought the row. 🆕 **v22 (2026-09-20) CLOSES Z4: `.wat` pin digests are PORTABLE** — 954 of 954 comparable files agree, up from 2. ⚠️ **The v17 annex named ONE cause and there were THREE**; the other two (an over-eager data-count section, and implicit import types interned after every tag's) were reachable only by the gate, because the file the byte-for-byte diagnosis ran on could not contain either. 🚨 **v22 also carries a NEW wazmrt defect the run found — B-d: `(type N)` naming an undeclared type binds an import to a signature the text never wrote, rc 0**, where wasmrt refuses. 🆕 **v23 (same day) FIXES B-d, and cross-runtime parity is now TOTAL: the two pin listings are 1,467 lines each, `.wat` 954 of 954 and `.wasm` 513 of 513, with nothing in one and not the other.** 🆕 **v24 lands §2.1's four SUBCOMMAND SPELLINGS — `run`/`wasi`/`wat`/`wast`, additively — which EMPTIES the 2026-09-19 outstanding list; `pin` on wasmrt's side is what is left in §2.1.** ⏳ **wasmrt's copy is therefore at 10 and BEHIND — PENDING MIRROR**, which §1a says the owner directs and wasmrt makes in its own tree · opened 2026-08-19 (owner) · 🆕 **v25 records two wazmrt defects that broke BINARY interop in both directions** — a block type emitted as an internal enum tag, and the `any`/`extern` conversion opcodes swapped at four agreeing sites — found by assembling the SPEC corpus with both toolchains; the real-world `.wat` parity claim is unchanged at 954/954, which is exactly why that corpus could not find them. · last change 2026-09-20 (v25) · **this file must be kept IDENTICAL
in both repos**, each side editing ONLY its own copy (§1a) (`wasmrt/cmem/interop.md` and `wazmrt/cmem/interop.md`).

> *"I think this may require a common memory md file in both projects to confer with each other on from
> this point further so that both projects are on the same end track."* — owner, 2026-08-19

This is the **only** document either project may treat as binding on the other. Everything else in
either `cmem/` is that project's own memory, and 🔒 **the oracle is still retired**: neither runtime is
authoritative over the other's design, and reading a competitor's implementation for guidance remains
off-limits. What lives here is a **contract about observable behaviour**, agreed by the owner, that both
must satisfy so a deployment can swap one binary for the other.

---

## 0. Scope — what "swappable" means

🔒 **Defined by the owner, 2026-08-19:** *"If our CLI options are the same they are swappable. If our
security checks are the same they are also swappable."*

**IN scope — must match:**

1. **CLI options** — run modes, flag names, argument shapes, defaults, exit codes.
2. **Security checks** — the pin/verification mechanism and its on-disk artifacts, the WASI sandbox
   rights model, and the resource ceilings.

**OUT of scope — deliberately NOT aligned:**

- **The C ABI.** `wasmrt_*` and `wazmrt_*` symbol prefixes are a recorded deliberate decision in both
  projects. An **operator** swaps the binary and the pin DB; an **embedder** links one or the other and
  is not expected to relink blind.
- **Internal design** — data models, IR, allocation strategy, crate/module layout.
- **Performance and size.** These are what the two are *competing on*; aligning them would defeat the
  purpose. A contract row must never be justified by "the other one is faster".
- **Conformance internals** — each project's own test harness, scoring and baselines.
- **Output text** — wording, layout and summaries, **with the ONE exception the owner made on
  2026-09-19: §2.5.** A validity claim a human reads must match the verdict. That is a
  correctness property, not a matter of style, so it is in scope. Everything else a command prints
  remains out of scope.

---

## 1. The change protocol — read this before editing

🤝 **The one-word order is "coordinate" (owner, 2026-08-19), and it is a BINDING TRIGGER in both
projects' `INDEX.md`.** Saying it means: run the procedure below and in that trigger — read this file
first, byte-compare the two copies, verify rows by **running** both rather than reading either, record
status + date + evidence, and bump the CONTRACT VERSION **in your own copy**. ⚠️ **It also binds in the
inverse direction, which is the half that gets skipped: coordinate BEFORE shipping a change to a
contract surface** — any CLI option, any security check, any resource ceiling, any exit code — **not
after**.

#### 🗓️ The coordination CADENCE and who holds the pen (owner, 2026-08-19)

> *"The wazmrt project is toward the end of the hardening phase. Theirs is the latest version. We will
> coordinate with them until this project also reaches that stage. Then both projects will cross
> coordinate at the end of each additional stage."*

**Two regimes, and which one applies depends on whether the projects are level.**

| regime | when | who originates | wasmrt's job |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A — wazmrt LEADS** | now, and until wasmrt finishes **hardening** (T9 → `1.0.1`) | **wazmrt only** | **mirror from them**, contribute findings as an **annex**, never originate a version number |
| **B — CROSS-COORDINATE** | once both have finished hardening | either, symmetrically | coordinate **at the end of each stage**, not continuously |

⚠️ **Regime A is not deference about design — it is about the PEN.** wazmrt is ahead by stage, so it
holds the contract's version sequence. wasmrt still measures, still objects, and still reports
divergences; it simply does not bump the number. **A finding is contributed as an annex and folded in
by whoever holds the pen** — which is how §2.1m's five measured findings are carried today.

⚠️⚠️ **Regime B is a GATE AT A STAGE BOUNDARY, not a background activity.** The stages are the `1.0.x`
ladder — clear-out, hardening, bug hunt, optimization, security review. **Coordinate at the end of
each**, so the contract is reconciled against code that has stopped moving. Coordinating mid-stage is
what produced **three mid-edit collisions in a single session on 2026-08-19**, each one two agents
writing the same file at the same moment.

🎓 **The lesson that cadence encodes, and it is the one this file kept re-learning the hard way: a
CONTRACT VERSION is a PIN, not a LOCK.** It makes drift *detectable*; it does nothing to prevent a
simultaneous write. **The fix is not a better marker — it is not writing at the same time.** One pen
while the projects are uneven, and a scheduled boundary once they are level.

**Where wasmrt is against that ladder:** `1.0.0` (the conformance clear-out, T13) is not started;
hardening is `1.0.1` and carries `pin`/T9e and the iteration budget/T9i. **So regime A holds for at
least the next two stages.**

### 1a. 🔒🔒 THE EDITING BOUNDARY — **ABSOLUTE** (owner, 2026-08-19)

> *"Let's place a note to not edit the other's md file unless specifically directed by me. This is just
> a coordination effort. Each project needs to edit their own files. This is important for tracking and
> integrity."* — owner

🚫 **NEITHER PROJECT WRITES ANYTHING INTO THE OTHER'S TREE. NOT THEIR `cmem/`, NOT THEIR SOURCE, NOT
THEIR TESTS — AND NOT THEIR COPY OF THIS FILE.** The only exception is an **explicit, specific
direction from the owner**, given for that edit. There is no standing permission, and `coordinate` does
**not** grant one — ⚠️ **`coordinate` is an order to CONFER, never a licence to WRITE.**

**This supersedes the earlier rule that made this file the one thing either side could write into the
other's tree.** It was wrong, and it was wrong in a way that had already caused damage twice in one
day: a blind copy destroyed a section of in-flight work, and the reconciliation destroyed another
(change-log rows 3b and 4). 🎓 **The reason is integrity of the record, not politeness — each repo's
history must show only what that repo's own agent did.** A commit in wasmrt authored by whoever was
working in wazmrt makes the history a bad witness, and *the history is the thing both projects fall
back on when a claim is disputed.*

### So how does a change reach both copies?

**By the owner, not by an agent.** The proposing side does all of this **in its own copy only**:

1. Write the change, bump the **CONTRACT VERSION**, and add a change-log row.
2. Mark the affected rows and the change-log entry **⏳ PENDING MIRROR** — meaning *agreed on this
   side, not yet carried across.*
3. **Tell the owner explicitly** that the sibling's copy is behind, and at which version.
4. The owner directs the other project to mirror it — and **that project makes the edit in its own
   tree**, which is what keeps its history honest.

⚠️ **A VERSION MISMATCH IS THEREFORE NORMAL NOW, AND IT MEANS SOMETHING PRECISE.** §1's drift rule
still holds — *a mismatch means the contract is unknown* — but the resolution is **never** "copy over
it". It is: **read both, report the delta and its direction to the owner, and wait to be directed.**
The mismatch is the coordination signal working, not a fault to be cleaned up unilaterally.

⚠️ **Reading the sibling's tree remains fine and is required by `coordinate`** — read their `cmem/`,
their in-flight uncommitted work, their source; run their binary. 🔒 **Read freely, write never.**
*(This does not reopen the retired oracle: reading their code for DESIGN GUIDANCE is still off-limits.
Reading it to check a CONTRACT ROW is what this file is for.)*

🔒 **THE RETIRED ORACLE'S SCOPE, SETTLED BY THE OWNER 2026-09-20 — it covers `wasmrt` AND NOTHING
ELSE.** `reference-projects.md` had a *"What to mine it for"* column and the sentence *"we study them
freely"*; this file said *"reading a competitor's implementation for guidance remains off-limits"*.
Both were current and binding-sounding and they could not both be followed. **The narrow reading is
the one that governs:** §1's subject is the sibling, so

| | reading their source for DESIGN GUIDANCE |
| --- | --- |
| **`wasmrt`** (the sibling) | 🚫 **off-limits by default** — each time needs an owner-directed scoped exception, logged. Two have been granted: Track B-e, and the `@custom` review |
| **the other eight** in `reference-projects.md` | ✅ **allowed** — that file's "mine it for" column stands, and adoption stays gated by the Adoption Checklist + a Component Ledger entry in `third_party/LICENSES.md` |

⚠️ **What is NOT restricted for either, and never was: behavioural MEASUREMENT.** Running another
implementation and comparing its output, bytes or exit codes is the method this project relies on most
— the whole custom-annotations design was measured off wasm-tools that way. *Measuring what a binary
DOES is not reading how it does it.*


1. **Neither project edits this file unilaterally.** A change is *proposed* in one repo — **in that
   repo's own copy only** — with a **CONTRACT VERSION** bump, and must be agreed and mirrored before
   either ships behaviour that depends on it. ⚠️ **The proposing agent does NOT carry it across**; the
   owner directs the other project, which makes the edit in its own tree (see the editing boundary
   above). *Superseded the original wording, which told one agent to "land the identical file in both
   repos" — that instruction is what produced two destructive overwrites on 2026-08-19.*
2. **Every row carries a status and a date.** ✅ AGREED (with the evidence that verified it) ·
   ⚠️ DIVERGENT (with the agreed resolution) · ⬜ UNVERIFIED (nobody has checked; **do not quote it**).
3. **Every accepted divergence carries a REOPEN CONDITION.** *An entry that loses its condition has
   become an excuse* — and a condition that is never re-tested is an excuse more slowly, so **re-test it
   whenever the entry is priced.**
4. **A row is verified by RUNNING both, not by reading either.** *When a claim will leave this repo,
   verify it against the artifact, not against something that talks about the artifact.*

⚠️⚠️ **THE DRIFT HAZARD, NAMED UP FRONT.** This file exists **twice**, and *a list written out a second
time is a list that will drift* — the projects have already been bitten by exactly this shape (a feature
list spelled three times; a header advertising a switch that was not there). Two repos cannot share one
file, so the pin is the **CONTRACT VERSION** plus rule 1. **The gate:** when both trees are present, a
check compares the two copies byte-for-byte and fails on any difference. Until that check exists, treat
a version mismatch between the copies as **the contract being unknown**, not as "close enough".


### 1b. What `coordinate` obliges, in order — ✅ **§0.5 RESTORED HERE (wazmrt, 2026-08-19)**

🚩 **This discharges the flag in change-log row 3b.** wasmrt's `cp` destroyed wazmrt's in-flight §0.5
before it reached either copy, and wazmrt's session context was the only place it survived. ⚠️ **It is
NOT restored as a verbatim §0.5, and that is deliberate:** three of its four parts have since been
re-expressed *better* — the order's definition in §1 above, and the editing boundary in §1a, which the
owner has since made **absolute** and which is therefore stronger than the version §0.5 was
introducing. **Re-pasting the section would leave two definitions of one order in one file, which is
precisely the "a list written out a second time is a list that will drift" failure this file exists to
prevent.** What follows is the part that was genuinely lost: the ordered checklist, and the clause
about invoking the order late.

1. **Byte-compare the two copies of this file** (§4 check 1). A mismatch means **the contract is
   unknown** — but see §1a: resolve it by **reporting**, never by writing to the other tree.
2. **Read the sibling's in-flight work** — its `cmem/roadmap.md`, `cmem/INDEX.md` and **uncommitted**
   changes — for anything touching §2 (CLI options) or §3 (security checks). ⚠️ **The sibling may
   already have written a task that cites a contract row THAT DOES NOT EXIST YET; that is a cue to
   write the row, not a discrepancy to report.** *(Not hypothetical: wasmrt's T9i cited "§3.7/§3.7a,
   CONTRACT VERSION 2" while this file was still at version 1 and had no such row.)*
3. **Diff what this project has shipped or is about to ship against every in-scope row**, and
   ⚠️ **verify by RUNNING both binaries on the SAME BYTES** (rule 4) — never by reading either
   implementation.
4. **Record the change in your OWN copy**, bump the CONTRACT VERSION, mark it ⏳ PENDING MIRROR, and
   **tell the owner the sibling is behind and at which version** (§1a).
5. **Report divergences with a reopen/close condition**, and record **where each side tracks the
   work**, so the two task lists can find each other.

⚠️ **`coordinate` is also the right response to discovering you have ALREADY diverged.** The order was
created the day wazmrt shipped an execution bound while this file still said neither project had one.
**Invoking it late is far better than not invoking it** — the drift is cheap to create and expensive to
find, and the correction is recorded rather than tidied away.

### 1c. 🚦 TWO SESSIONS ON ONE FILE IS A KNOWN FAILURE MODE (raised by wasmrt, 2026-08-19)

**wasmrt's diagnosis, and it is exactly right:** *"a version is a pin, not a lock — it makes drift
detectable, it does nothing to prevent a simultaneous write."* Both collisions on 2026-08-19 happened
because two sessions were editing this contract at the same moment; the CONTRACT VERSION told us
afterwards, which is not the same as preventing it.

**§1a removes the cross-tree half of that risk by construction** — neither side can now write into the
other's copy at all, so a simultaneous write can no longer destroy the other project's work. ⚠️ **What
it does NOT remove is two sessions editing the SAME copy** (two agents in one repo), where last-write
still wins and nothing detects it.

🚦 **Recommended to the owner, as wasmrt proposed: run coordination in ONE session at a time.** The
cheap discipline that makes the residual risk near-zero: when a `coordinate` pass is in flight in one
repo, do not run one in the other until it has reported.
---

### 1d. 🗓️ COORDINATION CADENCE — at the END of each track (owner, 2026-08-19)

🔒 **Decided by the owner.** Cross-project coordination runs **at the end of each track**, not
continuously and not mid-track.

| phase | what happens |
| --- | --- |
| **during a track** | build and gate normally; **do not** open a coordination pass. If the work touches an in-scope surface (§0), note it and carry it to the end-of-track pass |
| **end of a track** | run `coordinate` in full (§1b): compare copies, read the sibling's in-flight work, diff every in-scope row, **verify by running both on the same bytes**, record in your own copy, report to the owner |
| **then** | **pause and wait for the sibling to reach the same point.** The project that is ahead holds |

**Why end-of-track and not continuous:** a track is the unit that produces a *finished, gated* change,
and §1 rule 4 says a row is verified by **running both** — which needs something built and green to run.
Coordinating mid-track compares one settled implementation against one that is still moving, which
produces rows that have to be re-verified anyway.

⚠️ **This does NOT weaken the "coordinate BEFORE shipping a contract surface" rule in §1.** The two fit
together: *decide* a contract-surface change before building it, then *verify and record* it at the end
of the track. **zH3 violated the first half** — it was built while §3.7 still said neither project had a
bound — and the end-of-track pass is what caught it. **Both halves are needed; neither replaces the
other.**

🎯 **Current application (2026-08-19):** wazmrt finishes **Track H**, then **holds**. wasmrt coordinates
up to that same point. Cross-coordination resumes when both are at a track boundary. ⚠️ **While wazmrt
holds, its `1.0.1` is not "late" — waiting is the plan**, and a version that sits still because the
sibling is catching up is the cadence working, not a stall.

### 1e. 🔒 RELEASE LOCKSTEP — it ENGAGES WHEN wasmrt REACHES `1.0.1` (owner, 2026-09-21)

🗄️ **ENDED 2026-10-23, v33 (owner: *"we are officially out of lock step now due to differences"*).**
The two runtimes now differ BY DESIGN: wazmrt aligns `--features` with binaryang's D2, names and
meanings (v32), and the gate and the checklist are each repo's own. So neither runtime waits on
the other to release, and wazmrt's checklist gate 11 is retired. ⚠️ **What did NOT end:** the
contract rows (§2, §3) remain the shared reference for the CLI and security checks, and the
mirror rule (§1a: each side edits only its own copy, versions flow from the pen holder) stands.
The text below is kept as the record of what was agreed.

🔒 **Owner: *"wasmrt is catching up to this project and is about to release 1.0.0; when it hits 1.0.1 it
will be in lockstep."*** The trigger is **wasmrt's** version reaching `1.0.1`. From then on the two
runtimes release together.

🔒 **Owner, same day, later: wazmrt `1.0.2` SHIPS BEFORE wasmrt reaches `1.0.1`.**

| when | state |
| --- | --- |
| **now** | wazmrt **`1.0.1`**, Track B complete. wasmrt is **about to release `1.0.0`** |
| **wazmrt `1.0.2`** | ships on its own, under the ordinary checklist — lockstep is not engaged yet |
| **wasmrt `1.0.0`** | wasmrt's own milestone |
| **wasmrt `1.0.1`** | 🤝 **LOCKSTEP ENGAGES** |
| **after** | neither project releases until the **coordination pass** (§1b) has run and the **contract mirror is current**, meaning this file is identical in both trees |

⚠️ **CORRECTED THE SAME DAY — an inference is not a decision.** The first draft of this section said
the version numbers would be *equal* at engagement and *stay* equal. From that it concluded that a
wazmrt `1.0.2` would "move the target" and gave Track B a "second reason to hold". **The owner never
said the numbers must match.** The trigger is wasmrt reaching `1.0.1`, and the 1.0.2 decision makes
the difference explicit: at engagement wazmrt is expected to be *ahead* by one patch. 🎓 *A phrase
like "in lockstep" invites a precise reading the speaker did not make; record the trigger as said,
and ask before deriving a constraint from it.* ⬜ **Whether the numbers CONVERGE after engagement**
(does wasmrt skip to wazmrt's number, or do both move by their own patch increments?) is **not
decided** and nothing below depends on it yet.

📌 **This supersedes the wording in workspace letter H1**, which says *"lockstep at `1.0.0+`"*. The
owner's 2026-09-21 statement is the precise one: the engagement point is **`1.0.1`**, not `1.0.0` —
wasmrt passes through `1.0.0` without lockstep applying. ⚠️ **The letter is not wrong so much as
rounded**, and the difference is one whole release of wasmrt's during which neither side is held.

## 2. The CLI contract

🔒 **SETTLED 2026-08-19 (owner) — RESTORED 2026-08-19 after a concurrent-edit collision dropped it.**
**The two executables keep their own names — `wasmrt` and `wazmrt` — and that is the ONLY permitted
difference. Everything after the program name must be in sync.**

> *"The program will each be named separately wasmrt/wazmrt. That does not change. It is the CLI options
> that need to be in sync."*

**So there is nothing to decide about who adopts whose spelling — both adopt both.** The working test of
this whole section: **take any invocation, change only the program name, and it must do the same thing
under the other runtime.** That is what makes the tables below a specification rather than a survey, and
it is why §2.1's run modes are in scope alongside §2.2's flags — a command line is not portable if only
its flags are.

### 2.1 Run modes

wazmrt dispatches on the file extension and on whether an export was named; wasmrt uses explicit
subcommands. **The agreed target is ADDITIVE: each accepts the other's spelling, and neither loses the
form it already ships.**

| capability | wazmrt spelling | wasmrt spelling | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| summarize + validate, no execution | `wazmrt <module>` | `wasmrt <file>` | ✅ **AGREED on behaviour + exit code (both `rc=0`, neither executes) — ⚠️ MEASURED 2026-08-19, the OUTPUT TEXT differs.** *(The row read "already identical", which was written from reading and is false as stated.)* |
| call an exported function | `wazmrt <module> <export> [args…]` **and `run <module> <export> …`** | `wasmrt run <file> <fn> [args…]` **and the bare form** | ✅ **AGREED — both spellings on both sides.** wasmrt's F1 closed 2026-09-19; wazmrt took `run` 2026-09-20 (v24). 🔒 `run` does not fall back to WASI |
| run a WASI `_start` command | `wazmrt <module> [flags] [-- argv]` **and `wasi [flags] <module> …`** | `wasmrt wasi [flags] <file> […]` **and the bare form** | ✅ **AGREED 2026-09-20 (v24).** ⚠️ Under `wasi` the flags may precede the module on BOTH runtimes; `wasi` does not fall back to a summary |
| run a `.wast` spec script | `wazmrt <script.wast>` **and `wast <file\|dir>… [-v]`** | `wasmrt wast <file\|dir>… [-v]` **and the bare form** | ✅ **AGREED 2026-09-20 (v24).** 🔒 wazmrt gates every script, multi-target included — the path executes |
| assemble `.wat` → `.wasm` | `wazmrt wat <file.wat> [-o out]` | `wasmrt wat <file.wat> [-o out]` | ✅ **AGREED — wazmrt grew it 2026-09-20 (v24).** Without `-o` both assemble and report the size, writing nothing |
| pin a module for the DB | `wazmrt pin <file\|dir> [--db <path>]` | *(absent — `pin` is a stub)* | ⚠️ **wasmrt must grow it** |
| keypair / signing tools | `wazmrt keygen`, `wazmrt sign` | *(design-only)* | ⬜ **deferred** — reopen when either ships signatures |
| `-h`/`--help`, `-v`/`--version` | **first argument only** | **first argument only** | ✅ **AGREED** |

⚠️⚠️ **ALIGNING THE RUN MODES CHANGES WHAT A BARE PATH DOES, AND IT IS A SECURITY-POSTURE CHANGE.**
wazmrt's `will_execute` predicate is *"an export was named **or** the module exports `_start`"*, so
`wazmrt prog.wasm` **runs** a WASI command — while `wasmrt prog.wasm` today **summarizes** it. Adopting
the predicate means the most casual invocation there is starts **executing** code where it previously
only inspected it. 🔒 **The verification gate must land before, or with, that change — never after.**


#### ✅ 2.1z — **wasmrt's COLUMN IS GREEN (T9e, 2026-09-19); wazmrt's halves are what remain** · v20

✅ **Verified by running wasmrt's committed code** (built from `4e3de996` (was `51254b9cf`) into the pen-holder's own
scratch target dir, so nothing was written to wasmrt's tree — §1a):

| capability | verified |
| --- | --- |
| `wasmrt <module> <export> [args…]` | ✅ `valid.wasm add 2 3` → **`5`**, rc 0 |
| `wasmrt <script.wast>` by extension | ✅ `1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped`, rc 0 |
| `wasmrt pin <file>` | ✅ prints the digest line, rc 0 |
| `--dir` with **both** separators | ✅ rc 0 for `.:/` and `.::/` |
| `--features` both vocabularies | ✅ `bulk_memory` **and** `bulk-memory-operations` both accepted |

🎯 **F1 IS CLOSED.** `wasmrt valid.wasm add 2 3` now returns **5**. Earlier in this same session the
pen-holder measured it printing a summary and exiting 0 with the export silently ignored; T9e fixed it,
and Z1 with it. *The finding and its fix are hours apart, which is the cadence working.*

⏳ **Outstanding on wazmrt's side — measured, not assumed:**

| # | item | wazmrt today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **the subcommand spellings** | `run`, `wasi`, `wast`, `wat` | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-09-20, v24** (`b35940cb`) — all four accepted, additively, every bare form unchanged. The cell is the measurement that bought the row |
| **`::`** | the preferred separator | ⚠️ unsupported — **and `.:/` is broken too, §2.2z** |
| **the hyphenated feature vocabulary** | `bulk-memory-operations` | ⚠️ `error: --features: unknown proposal` — wazmrt accepts only `bulk_memory` |
| **Z1 / Z2 / Z3** | §2.3, §2.4a, §2.5 | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-09-19, v21** (`f780ad27`) — the cells above are the measurement that bought the rows and stay as written |
| **Z4** | the `name` section | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-09-20, v22** (`1bfdc6f5`) — **954 of 954 comparable `.wat` digests agree**, up from 2. See §3.1m |

✅ **ALL SIX ROWS MEASURED ON 2026-09-19 ARE NOW CLOSED.** The `::` and feature-vocabulary rows and
Z1–Z3 closed with v21; Z4 with v22; B-d with v23; the subcommand spellings with **v24**. ⚠️ Closed
means *measured closed*, not *finished forever* — §2.1's table is the live one, and the next
`coordinate` re-runs it rather than trusting this line.

⚠️ **RECORDED DIVERGENCE, and the pen-holder is NOT making it a contract row: `multi_table`.** wazmrt
models it as a proposal layered on `reference_types`; wasmrt does not model it separately (its
`reference-types` carries it), and **recognises the name, warns, and continues** — so wazmrt command
lines still run. Measured: `wazmrt --features all,-multi_table` → rc 0, restriction applied;
`wasmrt --features all,-multi_table` → rc 0 with *"`multi_table` is not a separate proposal"*.
🎯 **Why it stays an observation:** §0 puts *internal design* out of scope, and which proposals an engine
models separately is exactly that. ⚠️ **What IS in scope is the observable consequence, so it is stated
here rather than left implicit: the same `--features` line does not gate the same thing on both
runtimes.** A deployment that relies on `-multi_table` to exclude a capability gets that exclusion on
wazmrt and **a warning and no exclusion** on wasmrt. 🔒 **REOPEN as a contract row the moment either
side ships a module that one accepts and the other refuses on this basis** — that is the day it stops
being a modelling difference and becomes a swappability break.

#### 🔬 2.1m — FIRST MEASURED RUN of §4 check 5 (wasmrt session, 2026-08-19)

**Method:** `wasmrt 0.9.0 (abi 1)` release build vs `wazmrt 1.0.0 (abi 2)`, same box, same module
(a two-line `.wat` exporting `add`). ⚠️ **Exit codes were re-measured after the first attempt read
`$?` through a pipe and reported `head`'s status instead of the binary's** — *know what your
measurement tool omits* (`best-practices.md` §1.5).

**F1 — ⚠️⚠️ The two "call an export" gaps fail in OPPOSITE directions, and wasmrt's is the dangerous
one.**

| invocation | wasmrt | wazmrt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<prog> add.wat add 2 3` *(positional)* | **`rc=0`, prints the module SUMMARY — the export and both arguments are silently ignored, and it exits SUCCESS** | ✅ `rc=0`, prints `5` |
| `<prog> run add.wat add 2 3` *(subcommand)* | ✅ `rc=0`, prints `5` | ❌ `rc=1`, `error: cannot read 'run': FileNotFound` |

**Same missing capability; opposite consequence.** A wazmrt-shaped command run under wasmrt **does not
fail — it succeeds at the wrong thing**, which is the silent-wrong-output class this project ranks
worst. The mirror case is loud: wazmrt returns `rc=1` and says why. 🎓 *Which direction to err in is a
property of the consequence, not a house style* — so **wasmrt's half of this row is the higher
priority of the two**, even though the tables above give them equal weight.

**F2 — the "summarize" row was marked ✅ AGREED and the output text is not identical.**
`wasmrt` prints `<path>: WebAssembly module (version 1)` plus a multi-line section breakdown;
`wazmrt` prints `<path>: valid wasm v1, 4 section(s)`. **Behaviour and exit code do agree** (both
`rc=0`, neither executes). §0 puts run modes, flag names, argument shapes, defaults and exit codes in
scope — **not output text** — so this is **out of scope and recorded anyway**, because the row claimed
"already identical" and that sentence was written from reading, not running.

**F3 — 🆕 FLAG POSITION differs, and the contract does not have a row for it.** The flag tables list
names and argument shapes but never say *where the flags go*:

| invocation | result |
| --- | --- |
| `wazmrt <module> --dir <spec>` *(its documented order)* | ✅ `rc=0` |
| `wazmrt --dir <spec> <module>` *(wasmrt's order)* | ❌ `rc=1`, `error: cannot read '--dir': FileNotFound` |
| `wasmrt wasi --dir <spec> <module>` *(its order)* | ✅ preopen parsed |
| `wasmrt wasi <module> --dir <spec>` *(wazmrt's order)* | ⚠️⚠️ **no error — `--dir <spec>` is passed to the GUEST as argv, so the sandbox is never granted** |

⚠️⚠️ **The last row is a second silent failure, and it is a security one.** wazmrt's flags follow the
module path; wasmrt's precede it. A wazmrt user's muscle memory under wasmrt produces a run with **no
preopen at all** and **no warning** — the guest simply gets `BADF` on every path call, which looks like
a guest bug rather than a missing grant. **Position is part of an argument shape and belongs in §2.2 as
its own row.**

**F4 — 🔻 A CORRECTION: the single-colon `--dir` claim in §2.2 was wrong, and it was wrong because it
was written from READING the code.** The text asserted *"it does not error; it preopens the wrong
thing."* **Measured:** `wasmrt wasi --dir <host>:/s <module>` → `rc=1`,
`wasmrt: cannot preopen <host>:/s: errno 29`. **It fails loudly.** The separator divergence is real and
still needs the both-accept-both fix, but its consequence is a **clean failure**, not a silent
mis-preopen. *(Third read-not-verify error recorded across the two projects in two days — this one is
wasmrt's, and it had been carried in this contract as a ⚠️⚠️ since v1.)*

**F5 — `-v` output shape differs**: wasmrt prints one line (`wasmrt 0.9.0 (abi 1)`), wazmrt prints two
(adding `signature trust anchor: none …`). Out of scope as text; recorded because a script that parses
`--version` sees a different shape. *(The ABI numbers differ — 1 vs 2 — which is §0-out-of-scope by
design.)*

**What check 5 has NOT covered yet:** the `.wast` row, `--ro-dir`, `--allow-symlink`, `--env`, the
ceiling flags, `--` as an end-of-flags marker, and the whole of §2.3's per-failure exit codes. Those
rows stay ⬜ **UNVERIFIED** and **may not be quoted as agreed.**

### 2.2 Flags

| flag | wazmrt | wasmrt | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--dir <host>[<sep>guest]` | ✅ **BOTH `:` and `::`**, and 🆕 **the host half has a GRAMMAR** (2026-09-21, v27): `./p` `../p` `.` `..` `/p`, plus `<letter>:/p`, `<letter>:\p` and `\\srv\share` **on Windows only**. A bare relative path (`data`) and a drive-relative one (`C:`, `C:Users`) are SYNTAX errors, rc 1, before the filesystem is touched | ✅ **BOTH `:` and `::`** (2026-09-19), never mistaking a drive letter | ⏳ **DIVERGED — wazmrt has narrowed and wasmrt has not.** ⚠️ The ambiguous case is **gone on wazmrt rather than documented**: `x:/` is drive `X:` because `x` alone is no longer a legal host path at all. ⚠️ **UNMEASURED on wasmrt: their column records no host-path grammar, so `--dir data:/m` is expected to run there and is rc 1 here** — which would make this the first CLI row where wazmrt is the stricter side. **The check, not the conclusion:** run `--dir data:/m`, `--dir C:`, `--dir C:Users` on wasmrt from a directory containing `./data` and compare rc. Mirror per §1a, owner-directed |
| `--ro-dir` | same separator issue | same | ⚠️⚠️ as above |
| **flag POSITION** relative to the module path | flags come **AFTER** the path — 🆕🔒 **and a wazmrt flag written where only the guest sees it is an ERROR, `rc 1`** (v26, owner 2026-09-20; it WARNED from zH7, 2026-08-19 until then); nothing after an explicit `--` is examined, which is now the whole escape hatch. ⚠️ **See §5 #12** — this contradicts §2.4a's *"guest positions are never examined"* and `prog.wasm install --yes` now fails | flags come **BEFORE** the path | ⚠⚠ **DIVERGENT AND LIVE — MEASURED 2026-08-19 (F3).** wasmrt silently passes a trailing `--dir` to the GUEST, so the sandbox is never granted and nothing warns. |
| `--allow-symlink` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ **AGREED** (both added 2026-08-10) |
| `--env KEY=VALUE` | ✅ | ❌ absent | ⚠️ **wasmrt must add** |
| `--max-memory <size>` | ✅ | ❌ absent at the CLI | ⚠️ **wasmrt must expose** (the ceiling exists) |
| `--max-table-elems <count>` | ✅ | ❌ absent at the CLI | ⚠️ **wasmrt must expose** (the ceiling exists) |
| `--features <list>` | ✅ — 🔒 **v32 (2026-10-23): the VOCABULARY below is REVERSED by the owner, "we need to align with binaryang not wasm-tools"**: binaryang's D2 names become canonical, and the wasm-tools-only names stay as deprecated aliases for one minor release. 🔒 **v33: names AND meanings** (owner, 2026-10-23: "aligning with binaryang means its meanings also"): which feature gates which instruction follows D1's `feature` column, and the preset and dependency rules follow D2, not wasm-tools' measured ones. This answers wasmrt's §2.2m question. This row is rewritten when binaryang's FL1 settles D2's spellings. ⚠️ **wasmrt: do not implement v30's wasm-tools vocabulary in the meantime.** 🆕 **And it PRECEDES the module path, the only wazmrt flag that does; written after it is now an ERROR** (§2.4b, v16). 🆕🔒 **v30 (2026-09-21): wasm-tools' WHOLE vocabulary with wasm-tools' MEANINGS** — every name wasm-tools 1.259 accepts (component-model included; unimplemented proposals switch nothing), the presets `-all` `mvp` `wasm1` `wasm2` `wasm3` `lime1`, the group names (`bulk-memory` also switches `bulk-memory-opt`; `reference-types` also `call-indirect-overlong`), and **no configuration is refused** — only modules. Proven by `cmem/probes/feature-matrix.ts`: the same matrix run on both tools is **identical** | ❌ absent at the CLI. ⚠️ **CONTRADICTED 2026-09-21**: the letter-H8 / I6 measurement ran `wasmrt --features <name> <module>` for all 48 wasm-tools names and wasmrt ANSWERED — 20 known, the same 20 as wazmrt then — so this cell is stale | ⚠️ **wasmrt must match v30's vocabulary AND semantics**, checked by running `feature-matrix.ts` on it and diffing against wasm-tools — **and must adopt §2.4b's position rule** |
| `--max-iterations <count>` | ✅ (2026-08-19) | ❌ absent — **and so is the ceiling** | ⚠️⚠️ **DIVERGENT AND LIVE — see §3.7** |
| `--` ends host flags, rest is guest argv | ✅ — 🆕 **and it is now the ONLY way to hand a wazmrt-flag spelling to the guest** (v26; see the position row below) | ❌ (preopens must precede the path) | ⚠️⚠️ **wasmrt must add, and this got MORE urgent with v26**: without `--`, a wasmrt user has no spelling for a guest argument that collides with a host flag name |
| `--pins <path>` | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ **wasmrt must add** (with `pin`) |
| `--verify off\|warn\|enforce` | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ **wasmrt must add** (with `pin`) |
| `--no-verify`, `--yes` | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ **wasmrt must add** (with `pin`) |

⚠️ **THE `--dir` SEPARATOR IS A SWAPPABILITY BREAK THAT IS LIVE TODAY**, and it has nothing to do with
verification. `--dir .:/` is a working wazmrt invocation; on wasmrt the single colon is not the
separator. Each side has a real reason: a single `:` is ambiguous with a Windows drive letter
(`--dir C:\data:/data`), which is why wasmrt chose `::`.

🔻 **CORRECTED 2026-08-19 (F4), and the correction is folded in here by the pen-holder rather than left
in the annex** — because a refuted claim that stays in the table is what the next reader quotes. This
paragraph asserted *"it does not error; it preopens the wrong thing"* and **that was wrong**. Measured:
`wasmrt wasi --dir <host>:/s <module>` → `rc=1`, `wasmrt: cannot preopen <host>:/s: errno 29`. **It
fails LOUDLY.** The divergence is real and still needs the both-accept-both fix below, but its
consequence is a **clean failure**, not a silent mis-preopen — so it is downgraded from ⚠️⚠️ to ⚠️.
🎓 *The claim had been carried since v1 and was written from READING the code.* It is the **third**
read-not-verify error across the two projects in two days, and it is precisely why §1 rule 4 says a row
is verified by RUNNING both.

**AGREED RESOLUTION: both accept both.** Prefer `::`; fall back to a single `:` when the spec contains
no `::` **and** the split is not a drive letter. Converging on one spelling would break existing
invocations of the other, which is the opposite of swappable.

⚠⚠ **THIS ROW IS IN TENSION WITH v14 (§2.4a-i) AS OF 2026-09-19, AND IS FLAGGED RATHER THAN CHANGED.**
*"the split is not a drive letter"* is a **resemblance rule about a flag's VALUE** — the parser looks
at `C:\data:/data` and decides which colon the user meant. The owner's v14 instruction (*"no 'looks
like' built in"*) is written about options; this is the same mechanism one level down, and
🎓 **it is the single place in this contract where a heuristic is not just tolerated but AGREED.**
⚠️ **It is left standing until the owner rules — §5 #10.** Repealing an agreed row by implication is
exactly the unilateral move §1 forbids, and the alternatives are not free either: requiring `::`
everywhere breaks existing wazmrt invocations, and erroring on every ambiguous `:` breaks
`--dir .:/`, which is the form the docs use.

#### ⚠️⚠️ 2.2z — **`--dir .:/` DOES NOT WORK ON wazmrt, and it is the example wazmrt's own `--help` prints** (found by the pen-holder, 2026-09-19, v20)

**Measured, then confirmed in the source.** `wazmrt prog.wasm --dir .:/` →
`error: --dir '.:/': FileNotFound`. The spec was never split; the whole string was taken as the host
path. `--dir .::/` fails too (`--dir '.:'`). **wazmrt accepts NEITHER documented separator form.**

**The cause, from `src/main.zig`:** the split takes the **last** `:` **only when its index is > 1** —

```zig
if (std.mem.lastIndexOfScalar(u8, spec, ':')) |i|
    if (i > 1) .{ spec[0..i], spec[i + 1 ..] } else .{ spec, spec }
```

`i > 1` is the **Windows drive-letter guard**: it stops `C:\tmp` being split into `C` + `\tmp`. But in
`.:/` the colon is at index **1**, so a one-character *relative* host path is indistinguishable from a
drive letter and is silently not split. `--dir ./:/` works, because the colon moves to index 2.

| invocation | wazmrt | wasmrt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--dir .` | ✅ rc 0 | ✅ rc 0 |
| `--dir .:/` **(wazmrt's own help example)** | ⚠️⚠️ **rc 1, FileNotFound** | ✅ rc 0 |
| `--dir .::/` | ⚠️⚠️ **rc 1, FileNotFound** | ✅ rc 0 |
| `--dir ./:/` | ✅ rc 0 | ✅ rc 0 |

🎓 **THREE THINGS THIS IS, and they are worth separating.**
1. **A live defect**, not a divergence: wazmrt's documented invocation fails against wazmrt.
2. **A refuted contract claim.** §2.2 has said since v1 that *"`--dir .:/` is a working wazmrt
   invocation"*, and it was **written from reading, never run** — the *fourth* read-not-verify error
   across the two projects, and the second one found in this file's own text.
3. 🔒 **§5 #10 made concrete.** This IS the "looks like a drive letter" heuristic the owner's v14
   no-"looks like" rule put in tension, and here it **gives a wrong answer on ordinary input**. The
   decision is still the owner's — but it is no longer a hypothetical cost. ⚠️ **A fix that only adds
   `::` would leave this defect standing**, since `.:/` fails for a reason that has nothing to do with
   which separator is preferred.

⏳ **wazmrt's half is now two things, not one:** accept `::`, **and** stop mis-guarding a one-character
relative host path. Tracked at Track B → B-b.

### 📎 2.2f — wasmrt ANNEX (2026-09-20, unnumbered — regime A): **a flag row verified on PARSING is not verified**

Found by a validator review, not by a coordination pass, which is why it is here: the `--features` row
in §2.2 reads ✅ **DONE · both vocabularies resolve, same seeding, same layering refusals, must come
BEFORE the module path**. Every word of that is measured and true, and the flag was still **applied by
one of the three wasmrt paths that judge a module**.

| command | wazmrt (measured 2026-09-20) | wasmrt, before | wasmrt, after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<rt> --features mvp simd.wasm` (summarize) | refuses: *uses the 'simd' proposal, which --features excludes* | `validation OK` | refuses, naming `simd` |
| `<rt> --features mvp simd.wasm f` (call an export) | refuses | **ran it and printed `7`** | refuses |
| `<rt> wasi --features mvp simd.wasm` | refuses | refuses | refuses |

**The break was wasmrt's**, and it was live: the same command line ran on one runtime and was refused by
the other, which is exactly what §2's working test forbids (*change only the program name and the
invocation must do the same thing*). Fixed in wasmrt — `call_export` and `print_summary` now judge under
`flags.features`, like `run_wasi_loaded` always did — and pinned by
`crates/wasmrt/tests/cli_features_are_applied.rs`, one test per path, mutation-verified.

🔒 **No contract change is proposed.** The row's *content* was right; what failed was its verification.
The rule this adds is for §4's checks, and it applies to every flag row in §2.2: **verify by asserting
on what the command DID — the verdict, the exit status, the output — in every position AND on every
path the flag claims to govern.** §4.10's "test the spellings, not the flag" plus "and test the PATHS".
⏳ For wazmrt's session: worth re-running §2.2's other rows the same way (`--dir`, `--max-*`,
`--verify`, `--env`), since a flag that is parsed and dropped looks identical to one that works.

### 📎 2.2m — wasmrt ANNEX (2026-10-23, unnumbered — regime A): **the v11–v31 MIRROR, verified by running both**

*Owner-directed mirror (2026-10-23: "the contract range wasmrt must adopt, now v11–v31", then v32
the same evening).* wasmrt's copy was at **v10**. It is now wazmrt's **v32, verbatim** (mirrored from
wazmrt's committed `cmem/interop.md`), plus two wasmrt annexes not yet folded:
§2.2f (2026-09-20) and this one. No version number is originated here (regime A). The rows were then
**verified by running both binaries on the same command lines**: wazmrt `1.0.3`
(`zig-out/bin/wazmrt.exe`, built 2026-09-21) and wasmrt at the mirror commit.

| row | wasmrt BEFORE the mirror | now | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **v27** `--dir` host grammar | ❌ **in breach**: `data`, `data:/m`, `data::/m`, `C:` and `data/../data` were accepted (rc 0); `C:Users` and `~/x` failed only at the filesystem | ✅ **identical to wazmrt on 26 cases**, wording included; Windows-only drive and UNC forms | `crates/wasmrt/tests/cli_contract_dir_and_guest_position.rs`, inverted |
| **v26 / v28** exact host-flag name in a guest position | ❌ **in breach**: all 11 names passed to the guest (rc 0), with a warning for 3 | ✅ identical on 30 cases: the 11 names are rc 1; the `=value` forms, `--features`, `--help`, `--version`, `-h` and `-v` pass | same file, inverted |
| **§2.4b** `--features=<list>` | ❌ **a swappability break the row's own table implies**: `wazmrt --features=mvp m.wasm` ran, and wasmrt refused it as an unknown flag | ✅ applied before the path; after it, rc 1 naming the position. The ONLY `=` spelling either runtime takes (measured over 12 flags) | same file, inverted |
| v11 unknown flag · v15 single dash · v16 position | ✅ already identical (19-row probe) | ✅ | — |
| **v30** `--features` = wasm-tools' vocabulary and meanings | ❌ **NOT MET**: `cmem/probes/feature-matrix.ts` differs from wazmrt's output on **54 of 85 lines**. No `wasm1`/`wasm2`/`wasm3`/`lime1`/`-all`, no `floats`/`gc-types`/`call-indirect-overlong`…, and wasmrt refuses CONFIGURATIONS (`all,-simd` → "relaxed-simd requires simd") | ⏸️ **NOT implemented, by v32's direction** ("wasmrt: do NOT implement v30's wasm-tools vocabulary in the meantime"). wasmrt migrates ONCE, to binaryang's D2 vocabulary, when FL1 settles the spellings. ⚠️ Two v30 points are about MEANINGS rather than names (no configuration refused; module-level dependencies). 🔒 **Owner, 2026-10-23: "use v32"**: wasmrt follows v32 as written, so neither is implemented until the row is rewritten at FL1, and wasmrt still refuses `all,-simd` as a configuration until then | the matrix, run three ways. wasmrt also measured, from wasm-tools 1.262, each instruction's required feature set (492 instructions) and the bulk-memory / reference-types group splits; kept for the D2 migration |
| **v29** `.wat` pins | ❌ broken on purpose by wazmrt `1.0.2`'s H13 fixes: 64/528 agreed | ✅ **RESTORED 2026-10-23**: wasmrt made H13's three encoder fixes (locals in runs, exports in source order, implicit types interned in source order), plus I8 (an `@custom "name"` annotation is the only `name` section). Then **`wasmrt pin` = `wazmrt pin` on 603/603 `.wat` and 584/584 `.wasm` over wasmtk's corpus**, nothing on one side only, and **wasmrt's module bodies = `wasm-tools parse` on 603/603** | `scripts/body-parity.ts` (new gate); both runtimes' `pin <dir>`, compared file by file |

⚠️ **Oracle drift, for the pen-holder.** v30's matrix is proven "identical" against wasm-tools
**1.259**. wasm-tools **1.262** float-gates three relaxed-SIMD ops (`f32x4.relaxed_madd`,
`i32x4.relaxed_trunc_f32x4_s`, `f64x2.relaxed_min` refused under `all,-floats`) where 1.259 did not,
so wazmrt now differs from 1.262 on exactly those 4 matrix lines. wasmrt will target the row **as
written** (1.259's meanings, i.e. wazmrt's output) until the row says otherwise.

⚠️ **Stale wasmrt cells in §2.1/§2.2, for the pen-holder to refresh.** Several cells still describe
wasmrt before 2026-09-19 and contradict §2.1z ("wasmrt's column is green"): §2.1's `pin` row
("absent — a stub"), and §2.2's `--env`, `--max-memory`, `--max-table-elems`, `--max-iterations`,
`--`, `--pins`, `--verify`, `--no-verify`/`--yes` ("absent") and `--features` ("absent at the CLI").
All of them exist and were exercised by the probes above.

⚠️ **Observations on wazmrt's 2026-09-21 build** (letter H8; measured, not diagnosed; re-measure on a
current build): under `--features all,-memory64` a `(table i64 …)` module is ADMITTED; under
`all,-function-references` (GC on) `call_ref` is ADMITTED where wasm-tools refuses; and the table
initializer form is admitted with function-references AND GC off. **Each would breach v30** if the
current build still does it.

### 2.3 Exit codes

| behaviour | status |
| --- | --- |
| a WASI guest's `proc_exit(n)` becomes the process exit status (`n & 0xff`) | ✅ **AGREED** — verified in both, 2026-08-19 |
| success → 0, host-side failure (bad args, unreadable file, invalid module, refused by policy) → non-zero | ✅ **AGREED** |
| **specific non-zero codes per failure kind** | ✅ **AGREED (v13, 2026-09-19) — every host-side failure and every guest TRAP → `1` on both; `proc_exit(n)` → `n & 0xff`.** Measured twice by running both binaries: wasmrt's 18-row matrix (§2.3m) and the pen-holder's own 12-case re-run on the same bytes before folding — unreadable file, bad magic, unassemblable `.wat`, invalid module (summarize **and** call-an-export), wrong arity, unparseable argument literal, missing arguments, no arguments, and a trap: **`1` on both, in every one.** 🎓 **The row closes with no per-kind table, because neither implementation distinguishes kinds** — the portable contract is the success/failure split plus `proc_exit`, and writing a table of codes nobody emits would have been a list that drifts. Closes §5 decision #4. ⚠️ **REOPEN** the moment either side introduces a second non-zero code — that is the day scripts stop being portable across the swap. |
| 🆕 **naming an export the module does not have is a failure** — non-zero, with a message naming it; never a silent fall-back to summarizing (Z1, §2.3m) | ✅ **FOLDED IN AS CONTRACT VERSION 13 by the pen-holder (wazmrt, regime A), 2026-09-19.** 🔒 Owner decision, recorded by wasmrt; owner: *"pass all three issues to the wazmrt team"*. ⚠️⚠️ **THE ROW BINDS BOTH SIDES, and on the day it was folded in NEITHER was fully clean** — recorded that way deliberately, because a row written as "they must adopt" is a row its author stops testing. It is a case of row 2 (a bad argument), stated separately because wazmrt breaks it: `wazmrt m.wasm nosuch` prints the summary and exits **0**. wasmrt's `run` already complies (rc 1, *"no exported function `nosuch`"*). ⚠️ **wasmrt's bare-path form still has F1** (`wasmrt m.wasm f` summarizes, rc 0). That is the same class on wasmrt's side, and it stays open under §2.1. |

#### 🔬 2.3m — §2.3 MEASURED by running both binaries (wasmrt session, 2026-09-19) — 📎 ANNEX, ✅ **ACCEPTED AND FOLDED IN as v13** (wazmrt, pen-holder, 2026-09-19); kept in place as the measured evidence

*A wasmrt contribution under regime A: **not a version**, rows above deliberately left as the pen-holder wrote
them — ✅ **and the pen-holder has since folded them in as v13**, after re-running all of it (§2.5h-a). Triggered by the owner's `coordinate` on the one item wasmrt had logged as needing it: "`wasmrt <file>`
exits 0 on an invalid module".*

**Method.** Both copies of this file byte-compared first: **IDENTICAL at v10** (neither changed since
2026-08-19). Binaries: `wasmrt 0.9.0 (abi 1)` at `da17c367` (was `3c49845dd`), and `wazmrt 1.0.1 (abi 2)` from
`zig-out/bin`, built 2026-08-19 13:02. Its only later source commit is zH7 (13:05), and the binary
**already carries zH7** (verified: `wazmrt m.wasm x --dir .` prints zH7's warning). Nothing was built or
written in the wazmrt tree. Fixtures come from `wasm-tools parse`, which does not validate, so an ill-typed
module really reaches each validator. `rc` is read from the process, not through a pipe (§2.1m's lesson).

**Row 2 ("host-side failure → non-zero", ✅ AGREED) — wasmrt was in breach three times; wazmrt in none:**

| | invocation | wasmrt before | wazmrt | wasmrt after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **W1** | summarize an INVALID module (`.wasm` or `.wat`) | **0** | 1 | 1 |
| **W2** | no arguments at all | **0** (printed the version) | 1 (usage) | 1 (usage) |
| **W3** | `.wast` with a FAILED assertion / an UNPARSEABLE script / an UNREADABLE file | **0 / 0 / 0** | 1 / 1 / 1 | 1 / 1 / 1 |

✅ **Fixed on wasmrt's side**, pinned by `crates/wasmrt/tests/cli_exit_codes.rs`, which is mutation-verified.
This needs **no contract change**: it moves wasmrt ONTO a row both copies already carry. After the fix, an
18-row matrix agrees on success vs failure in every row. It covers summarize, call-an-export and WASI
`_start`, across valid, invalid, malformed, missing, trapping and `.wat` inputs. 🎓 *W1 is also why §2.1's
summarize row read "AGREED on exit code": it was measured on a VALID module only.* Skips in a `.wast` run do
**not** fail it on wasmrt: they are reported separately.

**Row 3 ("specific non-zero codes per failure kind", ⬜) — MEASURED, and the two already agree.**
Every host-side failure kind we exercised returns exactly **1** on both runtimes: unreadable file, bad
magic, unassemblable `.wat`, invalid module on every path, wrong arity, unparseable argument literal,
missing arguments, and usage. So does a guest **trap**. `proc_exit(n)` returns `n` on both (row 1).
📎 **Proposed for the pen-holder:** promote row 3 to *"✅ AGREED: every host-side failure and every trap
→ 1; `proc_exit(n)` → `n & 0xff`"*. That also closes **§5 decision #4** without a per-kind table. A script
cannot tell a trap from a refusal by code alone on either runtime, and nothing measured suggests it needs to.

**Observations for wazmrt.** Neither runtime is the oracle, so these are recorded, not diagnosed, and
fixing them is wazmrt's call in wazmrt's tree:

* **Z1 — the MIRROR of F1.** `wazmrt valid.wasm nosuch`, naming an export the module does not have,
  prints the summary and exits **0**. The name is silently ignored. wasmrt's `run` exits 1 with *"no
  exported function `nosuch`"*. Same class as F1 (an argument dropped, the run reported as success),
  on the other side.
* **Z2 — unknown flags have no row, and the two diverge.** `wazmrt m.wasm --bogus` exits **0** (the flag
  goes to the guest). wasmrt refuses an unknown option in either position: rc 1, *"use `--` to pass it
  to the guest"*. ⚠️ **Not a simple fix on either side.** wazmrt's flags-after-path form cannot tell a
  mistyped host flag from a guest argument without `--`, and §2.4 already records why that is dangerous
  (`… install --yes`). ✅ **DECIDED by the owner the same day → §2.4a**, which resolves the tension by
  *position* and, after the path, by *dash count* (v15): an unknown `--flag` errors, a `-flag` is the guest's.
* **Z3 — output text, out of scope (§0), recorded anyway.** wazmrt's summary header reads *"valid wasm
  v1, N section(s)"* for a module whose last line reports `validation: FAILED`. The exit code is right
  (1); the first line a human reads is not.

**§2.1m's "not covered yet" list, updated:** §2.3's per-failure exit codes and the `.wast` row's exit
behaviour are now covered. wazmrt also accepts `.wat` on its summarize and call paths (measured), so the
§2.1 "assemble" row concerns only the `wat` subcommand.

### 2.4 Flag-parsing rules that are part of the contract

- **`-h`/`--help` and `-v`/`--version` are recognised as the FIRST argument only**, so a `--help` inside
  a guest's argv is never the host's. ✅ AGREED.
- ⚠️ **Verification flags are recognised only in the LEADING RUN of host flags.** Scanning "everything
  before `--`" is **not** sufficient: the common WASI form has no `--` at all
  (`… prog.wasm install --yes`), so the guest's own arguments get searched and a `--yes` meant for the
  guest **silently disables verification**. wazmrt paid for this; wasmrt must not re-buy it.

### 2.4a Unknown flags — **an error, `unknown flag`** · 🔒 **OWNER DECISION 2026-09-19** · ✅ **CONTRACT VERSION 11 — FOLDED IN AND NUMBERED by the pen-holder (wazmrt, regime A), 2026-09-19**

> Owner, 2026-09-19: *"I do want an 'unknown flag' rule in the contract that throws an 'unknown flag' error."*

**The rule.** A flag-shaped argument (one beginning with `-`, other than `-` alone and the `--` marker)
that appears in a **host-flag position** and is not a flag that command recognises **stops the run
before anything executes**:

* stderr contains the words **`unknown flag`** and names the argument;
* the exit status is **1** (§2.3).

**Host-flag positions** (checked):
1. the **first argument**, apart from `-h`/`--help`/`-v`/`--version` (§2.4);
2. **anything before the module path**;
3. the **leading run of flags immediately after the module path**, which is wazmrt's flag position —
   🆕 **for a `--flag` only** (v15). Both runtimes accept flags there under §2.2;
4. **every argument** of a command that has no guest argv: summarize, `.wast`, and `wat`.

**Guest positions** (the guest's argv — 🔒 **AMENDED by the owner 2026-09-21, v28, closing §5 #12**):
* everything after an explicit **`--`** — **never examined**, passed verbatim. This is the one
  unconditional hand-off, and the spelling for a guest argument that is also a wazmrt flag name;
* everything after the **first non-flag argument** that follows the module path. That is the export
  name and its arguments (so `-1` stays a value), or a WASI program's argv. 🔒 **Examined for EXACT
  wazmrt host-flag names only**, and an exact match is an **error, rc 1** (§2.4b, §5 #11); anything
  else passes verbatim. So **`prog.wasm install --yes` is an error, and `prog.wasm install -- --yes`
  is how a guest receives its own `--yes`.** ⚠️ **EXACT names, never resemblance**: `--yess`,
  `--Yes` and `--dirs` are the guest's, untouched. v14's "no looks like" governs this examination
  too. 🎓 *The old text said "never examined" and had not been literally true since zH7 began
  warning on these tokens (2026-08-19); #11 changed the verdict, not the examination, and that is
  what exposed it. The amendment makes the text describe the code, not the reverse.*
* 🆕 **a SINGLE-DASH token in position 3** — the run immediately after the module path, in a mode that
  has guest argv. It is the guest's and needs no `--`: `prog.wasm -la` runs. **(v15)**

🆕 **Why position 3 splits by dash count** (owner, 2026-09-19, narrowing the rule the same day it was
written): **every host flag that can appear after the module path is double-dash** — `--dir`,
`--ro-dir`, `--env`, `--max-*`, `--pins`, `--verify`, `--no-verify`, `--yes`, `--features`,
`--allow-symlink`. The single-dash names (`-h`, `-v`) are first-argument-only (§2.4), and the
subcommand flags (`wast -v`, `wat -o`) belong to modes with **no guest argv**. So a single-dash token
there **cannot be a host flag**, there is nothing to disambiguate, and demanding `--` would only make
`prog.wasm -la` longer. A `--flag` in that position genuinely could be either, so an unknown one errors.

⚠️ **What that costs, recorded rather than smoothed over.** A mistyped host flag with one dash —
`-dir /tmp` for `--dir /tmp` — reaches the guest silently, so the preopen is never granted and nothing
says so. 🔒 **The owner considered a "looks like a host flag" warning for exactly this case and refused
it** — *"I do not want the 'looks like' part. If it is not a proper cli option throw the error"* (as
recorded in wasmrt's copy), and to this session the same day: *"We should have no 'looks like' built in
so that it interprets a cli."* A token is judged by its POSITION and by whether the command knows it,
**never by resembling a flag name**. 🎓 **A near-miss list is itself a thing that would drift between
the two runtimes** — which is this file's oldest lesson applied to a helpfulness feature.

⚠️ **The other consequence, which stands:** a guest's own `--help` directly after the path is an
unknown flag — `prog.wasm -- --help` is the spelling. That is the rule doing its job, since `--dirr`
must not slip past silently. The CLI help says so on wasmrt.

**zH7 is unchanged and complementary.** A **known** host flag stranded in a guest position still only
*warns* (it may be the guest's own); an **unknown** `--flag` in a host position *errors*.

#### 2.4a-i 🔒🔒 **NO "LOOKS LIKE" — an argument is a RECOGNISED option or it is an ERROR** · **OWNER DECISION 2026-09-19** · ✅ **CONTRACT VERSION 14**

> Owner, 2026-09-19: *"improper cli options should throw an error. We should have no 'looks like' built
> in so that it interprets a cli. If it is a valid cli option run it, if not throw and error."*

🎯 **This is the GENERAL rule that §2.4a is one instance of, and it is stronger than §2.4a alone.**
§2.4a says an unrecognised flag in a host position errors. **v14 says the host parser may not
RESEMBLANCE-MATCH anything, ever.** Within a host-flag position an argument is compared against the set
of options that command accepts: **exact match → run it; anything else → `unknown flag`, rc 1.** There
is no third branch, and in particular these are all now **forbidden**:

| forbidden | what it looks like in practice | why it is forbidden |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **guessing a flag is a PATH** | ⚠️ wazmrt today: `wazmrt --bogus m.wasm` → *"cannot read '--bogus': FileNotFound"* | the exit code is right and **the message sends the user to look at the filesystem for a typo in their flag.** This is the purest case of the rule: the parser decided what the argument *resembled* |
| **fuzzy / "did you mean"** matching | `--dirr` → silently treated as `--dir`, or corrected | a near-miss that RUNS is the silent-wrong-output class with a helpful face on it. ⚠️ **Printing a suggestion is not the same as acting on one** — the error may name near spellings, it may not adopt one |
| **prefix / abbreviation** matching | `--max` accepted for `--max-memory` | today's unambiguous abbreviation becomes ambiguous the moment a flag is added, so it silently changes meaning across versions |
| **"probably the guest's"** inference in a **host** position | ignoring an unknown flag after the path because it might be argv | this is Z2 exactly, and it is what §2.4a already killed |
| **inferring a flag from its VALUE's shape** | treating `-1` as a flag, or a flag as a value, based on what it resembles | §2.4a settles this **by position**, and position is grammar — see below |
| **a "did you mean a host flag?" warning** on a near-miss | warning that `-dir /tmp` looks like `--dir /tmp` before passing it to the guest | 🔒 **the owner considered exactly this case and REFUSED it** (v15). It is the most tempting form of the rule to break, because the thing it would catch is real |

⚠⚠ **WHAT v14 DOES *NOT* TOUCH, and the distinction is the load-bearing one: GRAMMAR IS NOT
RESEMBLANCE.** The host/guest boundary in §2.4a is fixed by the **shape of the command line** — an
explicit `--`, the first non-flag argument after the module path, and 🆕 **the DASH COUNT of a token in
position 3** (v15) — **not by judging what an argument looks like.** 🎯 **Dash count is the clearest
case of the distinction:** *"a single dash after the path is the guest's"* is a fact about the shape of
the line that holds for every possible token; *"`-dir` looks like `--dir`"* is a guess about one. The
first is decidable and stable, the second is a list that drifts. A WASI guest's argv is not "a cli option wazmrt failed to recognise"; it is **not
addressed to wazmrt at all**, and the grammar says so before any matching happens. 🔒 **This is not a
loophole in v14, it is the reason v14 is implementable:** a rule that made every argument on the line
either a valid host option or an error would make `prog.wasm install --yes` impossible to write, and
§2.4 records what that costs — a guest's own `--yes` **silently disabling verification**, a trap this
project has already paid for once.

⚠️ **TWO THINGS v14 PUTS IN TENSION, BOTH FLAGGED FOR THE OWNER RATHER THAN DECIDED HERE:**

1. ⚠⚠ **§2.2's agreed `--dir` separator fallback is itself a "looks like" rule** — *"fall back to a
   single `:` when the spec contains no `::` **and the split is not a drive letter**"*. Deciding
   whether `C:` is a drive letter or a host path is **exactly** the resemblance-matching v14 forbids,
   and it is not a flag NAME but a flag VALUE. **§5 #10.** *(It was agreed before v14 existed; it is
   raised, not overridden — the pen-holder does not get to repeal an agreed row by implication.)*
2. **zH7's WARN.** A *known* host flag stranded in a **guest** position warns rather than errors,
   because it may genuinely be the guest's. Under v14 that is grammar, not resemblance, so it stands as
   written — but it is the nearest neighbour to the rule and the owner may want it to error. **§5 #11.**

**Status — MEASURED 2026-09-19 by running both, on flag NAMES:**

| probe | wazmrt 1.0.1 | wasmrt 0.9.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **prefix / abbreviation** — `--max-mem` for `--max-memory`, `--vers` for `--version`, `--outp` for `--output` | — | ✅ `unknown flag`, rc 1 — **not accepted** |
| **near-miss spelling** — `--dirr` | — | ✅ `unknown flag`, rc 1 — **named, not adopted** |
| **flag-shaped argument in a host position** — `--bogus`, `-Dbogus` | ⚠⚠ *"cannot read '-Dbogus': FileNotFound"* — **guessed it was a path, in both probes** | ✅ `unknown flag`, rc 1 |

✅ **wasmrt COMPLIES on flag names** — four probes, no abbreviation and no fuzzy adoption; it names the
argument and stops. ⚠⚠ **wazmrt is in breach** (the path-guess, reproduced on a second spelling, plus
all of §2.4a). ⬜ **Neither side's flag-VALUE parsing has been swept for resemblance rules** — that is
a different surface from the names measured here, and §2.2's drive-letter fallback is a known instance
of it sitting in this contract as **AGREED** (§5 #10). Tracked for wazmrt at Track B-b.

### 2.4b 🆕 A flag with a REQUIRED POSITION, written where it cannot apply, is an **ERROR** · 🔒 **OWNER DECISION 2026-09-19** · ✅ **CONTRACT VERSION 16**

> Owner, 2026-09-19: *"If the `--features <list>` has to go before the module, we need to identify
> that in the invocation and help sections for sure, and we need an error thrown when it is in the
> wrong location."*

**The rule.** Where a command accepts a flag **only** in one position, that flag appearing in a
**different host-flag position** stops the run: stderr names the flag **and the position it requires**,
and the exit status is **1**. It is never ignored, and never merely warned about. ⚠️ **Guest positions
stay untouched** (§2.4a as narrowed by v15) — after `--`, or after the first non-flag argument, the
token is the guest's.

🎯 **It also binds the HELP, which is half of what the owner asked for.** A flag with a required
position must state that position in the usage/invocation section, not only in its own entry further
down. *A constraint documented only where the reader already knows to look is not documented.*

**Today the only such flag is wazmrt's `--features`,** which must precede the module path. 🔒 The
reason it cannot simply be accepted in both places is recorded at its parse site and is a real one: in
run mode the export name must be `args[2]`, so a trailing flag region would silently change which mode
`wazmrt prog.wasm --dir .:/ add 2 3` selects for a module exporting both `add` and `_start`. Nor may it
be read from the trailing region at all — a guest's own `--features mvp` must never narrow the
language wazmrt accepts, the same reasoning that keeps `--no-verify` out of there.

| | wazmrt **before** (1.0.1 as shipped) | wazmrt **after** (this change) | wasmrt |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--features` before the path | ✅ applies | ✅ applies | — **no `--features` at the CLI yet** (§2.2) |
| `m.wasm --features mvp` | ⚠️⚠️ **rc 0 — ran under the FULL feature set, in SILENCE** | ✅ rc 1, names the required position | — |
| `m.wasm --features=mvp` | ⚠️⚠️ **rc 0 — same** | ✅ rc 1 | — |
| `m.wasm --dir . --features mvp` | ⚠️⚠️ **rc 0 — same** | ✅ rc 1 | — |
| `m.wasm -- --features mvp` | rc 0 — the guest's | ✅ rc 0 — unchanged | — |
| `m.wasm guestarg --features mvp` | not warned by zH7 | ✅ unchanged (guest position) | — |

⚠️⚠️ **THE DEFECT THIS FOUND IS WORSE THAN THE MISSING ERROR, and it is why this is a contract row
rather than a help-text fix.** `--features` is the one wazmrt flag whose entire job is to **REFUSE**
modules — a smaller trusted computing base. Written after the path it was **silently dropped**, so a
user who asked for `mvp` got every proposal enabled, with **no error, no warning, and a successful exit
status**. 🎓 **That is the fail-OPEN direction on a security control**, the same shape as zH2's ignored
GC ceiling and as §2.4's `install --yes` trap. **zH7 did not catch it**: zH7 warns for names in
`flagRegion`'s lists, and `--features` is deliberately absent from them, so it fell between the two
mechanisms that exist to prevent exactly this. 🎓 *A rule that names the things it guards will not
guard the thing it does not name.*

✅ **Shipped in wazmrt** — `misplacedFeaturesFlag` in `src/main.zig`, pinned by two tests (one for the
rule, one proving its walk matches `flagRegion`'s), **inversion-proven**: stubbing the detector to
`return null` fails the first test, and the suite is green restored (767 tests, 4 skipped for the known
exFAT symlink cases). ⚠️ **wasmrt is not in breach** — it has no `--features` at the CLI at all (§2.2
already records that as *"wasmrt must expose"*). **This row binds it when it adds one.**

### 2.5 A validity claim in the output must match the verdict (Z3) · 🔒 **OWNER DECISION 2026-09-19** · ✅ **CONTRACT VERSION 12 — FOLDED IN AND NUMBERED by the pen-holder (wazmrt, regime A), 2026-09-19**

> Owner, 2026-09-19: *"we also need a contract item for Z3"*.

**The rule.** No line a command prints may describe a module as **valid** unless it validated. The
exit status (§2.3), any verdict line, and any header or summary wording must **agree**. A summary that
prints before validation finishes must use neutral wording ("WebAssembly module", "wasm v1", section
counts), never "valid". **Only validity claims are in scope** (§0); the rest of the output text is not.

| | wazmrt (measured 2026-09-19, 1.0.1) | wasmrt | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| summary of an INVALID module | ⚠️ header `…: valid wasm v1, 4 section(s)`, then `validation: FAILED …`, rc 1 | header `…: WebAssembly module (version 1)`, then `validation FAILED: …`, rc 1 | ⚠️ **wazmrt must adopt** (the header) |

wasmrt is pinned by `cli_exit_codes.rs::the_summary_never_calls_an_invalid_module_valid`. That test
**fails when wazmrt's header wording is injected into wasmrt's summary** (mutation-verified), so it
checks exactly this.

### 📬 2.5h — HANDOFF TO wazmrt (owner-directed, 2026-09-19)

Owner: *"lets pass all three issues to the wazmrt team."* Passed **through this file**, because §1a
forbids writing into wazmrt's tree. For wazmrt's own session to adopt in wazmrt's own commit:

| # | issue | contract item | wazmrt action | verify by running |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Z1** | an unmatched export name is silently ignored (rc 0) | §2.3, new row | fail with rc 1 and name the export, when the argument can only be an export name | `wazmrt m.wasm nosuch` → rc 1 |
| **Z2** | unknown flags are ignored or misreported | **§2.4a** (owner decision, **as narrowed by v15**) | `unknown flag`, rc 1, in every host-flag position — but after the module path **only for a `--flag`**: a single-dash token there is the guest's, and no "looks like" guessing anywhere (v14) | `wazmrt m.wasm --bogus`, `wazmrt --bogus m.wasm` and `wazmrt s.wast --bogus` → `unknown flag`, rc 1; `wazmrt m.wasm -- --bogus` **and `wazmrt m.wasm -la`** → untouched |
| **Z3** | the summary header says "valid" for an invalid module | **§2.5** (owner decision) | neutral header wording until validation has passed | `wazmrt invalid.wasm` → no line claims validity; rc 1 |

⚠️ **Z1 needs care on wazmrt's side.** Its bare path runs `_start` when the module exports one, so a
following word may be guest argv rather than an export name. The failure applies when the word **can
only be** an export name: the module has no `_start`, or the word is in the export position of an
explicit call form. How wazmrt draws that line is its design call; the observable requirement is only
*"never silently succeed at something other than what was asked"*.

#### ✅ 2.5h-a — THE HANDOFF IS ACCEPTED, AND ALL THREE RE-MEASURED BEFORE ACCEPTING (wazmrt, pen-holder, 2026-09-19)

⚠️ **The pen-holder did not fold these in on the strength of the annex.** §1 rule 4 says a row is
verified by **running both**, and that applies to a row arriving from the sibling exactly as it applies
to one this side wrote. All three were re-run here, on the same bytes, before any of them was numbered:

| # | invocation | wazmrt 1.0.1 (re-measured) | wasmrt 0.9.0 (re-measured) | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Z1** | `wazmrt valid.wasm nosuch` | **rc 0**, prints the summary; `nosuch` silently dropped | `run`: **rc 1**, *"no exported function `nosuch`"* | ⚠️ **confirmed — wazmrt in breach** |
| **Z2** | after the path (`m.wasm --bogus`) | **rc 0** — handed to the guest | **rc 1**, `unknown flag` | ⚠⚠ **confirmed** |
| **Z2** | before the path (`--bogus m.wasm`) | rc 1, but *"cannot read '--bogus': FileNotFound"* | **rc 1**, `unknown flag` | ⚠️ **confirmed — right code, wrong reason** |
| **Z2** | `.wast` (`s.wast --bogus`) | **rc 0** — ignored | **rc 1**, `unknown flag` | ⚠⚠ **confirmed** |
| **Z2** | guest position (`m.wasm -- --bogus`) | untouched, rc 0 | untouched | ✅ **agreed — the carve-out works** |
| **Z3** | `wazmrt invalid.wasm` | header `invalid.wasm: valid wasm v1, 5 section(s)`, then `validation: FAILED …`, rc 1 | `invalid.wasm: WebAssembly module (version 1)`, then `validation FAILED: …`, rc 1 | ⚠️ **confirmed — wazmrt in breach** |

🔎 **And one thing the re-run adds, which is why re-running mattered: `wazmrt invalid.wasm bad` — the
CALL form on an invalid module — already exits 1.** Z1 is therefore **not** a general "wazmrt ignores the
export name" defect; it is specific to the **export-name lookup on a module that validates**. The word is
dropped only on the path where everything else succeeded, which is the narrowest and most deceiving
version of the bug: *the run that silently does the wrong thing is the one where nothing else went wrong.*

⚠️ **F1 IS STILL LIVE ON wasmrt, and the pen-holder verified it rather than taking the note on trust.**
`wasmrt valid.wasm nosuch` → **rc 0**, summarizes, drops the name — identical in shape to Z1. wasmrt's own
copy says so (§2.3, §2.1) and this is not a counter-charge; it is the reason the §2.3 row above is worded
as binding on **both** sides. 🎓 **wasmrt's compliance is via its `run` subcommand; its bare-path form is
in breach of the row it authored.** *A project is least likely to run a new check against the form it did
not have in mind when it wrote the check.*

🆕 **v15 RE-MEASURED THE SAME DAY (the narrowing arrived mid-pass), and it MOVED the line in both
directions:**

| invocation | mode | wazmrt | wasmrt | v15 requires |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `start.wasm -la` (`_start` present) | **has** guest argv | rc 0 — guest's | rc 0 — guest's | ✅ **both correct** — `-la` runs, no `--` needed |
| `start.wasm --bogus` | **has** guest argv | **rc 0** | rc 1, `unknown flag` | ⚠⚠ **wazmrt in breach** |
| `valid.wasm -la` (no `_start`) | **no** guest argv | **rc 0** | rc 1, `unknown flag` | ⚠⚠ **wazmrt in breach** — the carve-out does not apply |

🎯 **The middle and last rows are the whole point of measuring after a narrowing rather than assuming
it shrank the work.** v15 genuinely removed one obligation from wazmrt (`-la` with `_start`: already
right). ⚠️ **It removed nothing in a mode with no guest argv** — there, *every* argument is a host
position under §2.4a item 4, both dash forms, and wazmrt ignores single-dash tokens there today.
🎓 **An implementer reading only v15's headline — "after the path, one dash is the guest's" — would
apply it in summarize mode and ship a second Z2.**

📍 **Where wazmrt tracks the work: `cmem/roadmap.md` → Track B → B-b.** ⚠️ **Nothing is adopted in
wazmrt's code by this fold-in — deliberately.** §1d puts adoption at a track, and §1's other half
("coordinate BEFORE shipping a contract surface") is what this pass **is**: the rule is decided and
numbered first, then built. Adopting it inside a coordination pass would invert exactly the order that
§1d exists to enforce.

## 3. The security-check contract

### 3.1 What gets hashed — the TOCTOU rule

| rule | status |
| --- | --- |
| hash the **in-memory bytes about to execute**; never re-read by path | ✅ **AGREED** — `bytes-hashed == bytes-run` by construction |
| a `.wat` input hashes the **assembled** bytes, not the source text | ✅ **AGREED** as a rule. ⏳ 🚨 **PORTABILITY BROKEN ON PURPOSE by wazmrt `1.0.2` (2026-09-21, v29), PENDING wasmrt's matching fix.** Workspace letter H13 found both runtimes' bodies diverging from wasm-tools in three ways (I12 local runs, I13 export order, I14 type interning order) — hidden because the runtimes matched EACH OTHER. wazmrt fixed all three (`9aee871d1`: 528/528 bodies equal wasm-tools'), so **measured against wasmrt's build of 2026-09-20: `.wat` pins agree on 64 of 528 and differ on 464** (`cmem/probes/pin-parity.ts`), where they agreed on 528. The 464 are exactly the files the fix changed. `.wasm` pins are untouched. ⚠️ **Parity returns when wasmrt makes the same three fixes** — the letter asks it to, and the check is `probes/body-parity.ts` against wasm-tools, not against wazmrt. 🔒 Owner: shipped in `1.0.2` anyway, *"since the consumers are not involved yet"*. *(Superseded:)* ✅ **PORTABLE since 2026-09-20 (Z4 closed, v22).** 954 of 954 comparable `.wat` files in the `wasmtk` tree now hash identically under both runtimes, up from 2; `.wasm` was and stays 513/513. **See §3.1m for the 2026-09-19 divergence and §3.1m-r for the close.** ✅ **And since v23 the two listings are the same length — 1,467 lines each, nothing in one and not the other** (B-d fixed, §3.1m-r). |
| a `.wast` script hashes the **script bytes** — every module it can run is contained in them | ✅ **AGREED** |
| the file is read **once**; no path is reopened after load | ✅ **AGREED** in behaviour · ⚠️ **wasmrt is making it a compiler-checked type** (`Loaded { bytes, digest }`), wazmrt passes a slice — an implementation difference, not a contract difference |

⚠️⚠️ **`.wast` MUST BE GATED.** A script instantiates and invokes the modules it contains — including
`(module binary "…")` raw payloads. wazmrt shipped this bypass: `wazmrt payload.wast` ran unpinned,
unsigned wasm **even under a root-owned `# mode: enforce`**. **Any wasm can be wrapped in a `.wast`, and
the attacker chooses the extension, so the bypass needs no privilege.**

#### 🔬 3.1m — `.wat` DIGESTS DIVERGE, and the cause is the `name` section · 📎 wasmrt annex, ✅ **ACCEPTED AND FOLDED IN as v17** (wazmrt, pen-holder, 2026-09-19)

**§3a decision 2 said to make the `.wat` agreement a TEST rather than an assumption. Run, it fails.**
Both runtimes' `pin` hashes the assembled bytes, so the digests compare directly — one command per file.

| corpus | wasmrt's run (535 files) | 🔬 **the pen-holder's own re-run (959 files, whole `wasmtk` tree)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| agree | **2** | **2** |
| differ | **529** | **952** |
| one/both refuse | 4 | 5 |

✅ **THE DIAGNOSIS IS CONFIRMED BYTE-FOR-BYTE, not taken on trust.** On `wasmtk/src/wasm/mathlib.wat`:

| artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| wasmrt's assembled output | `8fc0e0c4…` — **equals `wasmrt pin`** |
| the same, `wasm-tools strip --all` | `821a3b51…` — **equals `wazmrt pin`, exactly** |

`wasm-tools objdump` shows the difference is **one section**: `custom "name"`, 2020 bytes. Types,
functions, globals, exports and code are byte-identical, at identical offsets. **wasmrt emits a `name`
section built from the text's identifiers (as wasm-tools and wasmtime do); wazmrt emits none.**

🎯 **The mechanism is confirmed by the exceptions, which is the strongest evidence in the run.** The
**only two files out of 959 whose digests agree are the only two containing zero `$identifiers`** — no
identifiers, so wasmrt has no names to emit, so no `name` section, so the digests match. *The rule and
its exceptions have the same single cause.*

🔒 **Consequence for an operator: only `.wasm` pins are portable.** A `.wat` pinned under one runtime is
**refused** under the other. That fails **CLOSED** — a denial, never a silent run — so it is an
operational break, not a security hole. ⚠️ Until Z4 lands, an installer that pins `.wat` must pin **per
runtime**, and that limitation belongs in the deployment docs rather than being discovered.

📬 **Z4 is wazmrt's to fix, and the ask is the right one:** emit the `name` section from the identifiers
the text carries. 🔒 It also matches the owner's standing direction **not to discard information the
source carries** — the `.wat` text *has* the names, and dropping them is a lossy assemble.
⚠️ **Note what Z4 is NOT:** it is not "match wasmrt's bytes". It is "stop throwing the names away". The
digests converging is the *test* that it worked, not the goal. **Tracked at Track B → B-b.**

##### ✅ 3.1m-r — Z4 IS CLOSED · **CONTRACT VERSION 22** (wazmrt, 2026-09-20, `1bfdc6f5`)

**Re-measured with the same command on the same tree, the sibling rebuilt from its committed
`ff99f6f1` (was `ab13ba975`) into a scratch target dir (nothing written to its tree, §1a):**

| | `.wat` agree | differ | `.wasm` agree |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-19 | 2 | 952 | 513 |
| **2026-09-20** | **954** | **0** | 513 |

🔑 **The annex above named ONE cause and there were THREE. The other two could only be found by the
gate, not by the diagnosis** — and the diagnosis was not wrong, it was complete for the file it was
run on. `mathlib.wat` has no unused data segment and no tag, so neither of the other two causes could
show up in it. *A single-file byte-for-byte confirmation proves the cause it finds and says nothing
about the ones it cannot reach.*

| # | cause | fixed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | no `name` section | emit it, twelve subsections, shape read off a wasm-tools-assembled module |
| 2 | data-count section emitted for **every** module with a data section | emit it exactly when a body names a segment, per §5.5.16 — which is what wasm-tools does |
| 3 | an imported function's implicit type interned **after** every tag's | intern at the import, in source order alongside the tags; defined functions stay a later pass |

⚠️ **The operator consequence in §3.1m is now the other way round and the docs must follow: `.wat`
pins ARE portable between the two runtimes** for every file both assemble. ⏳ **PENDING MIRROR** —
wasmrt's copy is behind; the owner directs that edit (§1a).

🚨 **AND A NEW wazmrt DEFECT THE RUN FOUND, which is why the count is 954 and not 956.** Two corpus
files (`bindgen_fixtures/fnany_50.wat`, `hostfn_50.wat`) write `(type 0)` / `(type 1)` in an import's
typeuse while declaring no types at all. **wasmrt refuses them** (*"inline function type doesn't match
type reference"*). **wazmrt assembles, validates and runs them — with the imports bound to signatures
the text never wrote**: `__host_print`, written `(param i32 i32)`, comes out as
`(param i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32)`. `rc 0`, no warning. 🔑 The cause is time-of-check:
`checkInlineTypeUse` skips itself when the referenced index is not interned *yet*, deferring to a
"downstream verdict" that never arrives because the emitter later manufactures a type at that index.
**This is a §2.5-class failure (a truthful validity claim) and it is wazmrt's.** Tracked as **B-d**.

✅ **B-d IS FIXED — CONTRACT VERSION 23, same day** (`35d8aa4b`). Every typeuse carrying both forms is
recorded and answered once the type space is complete; both files are refused here as wasmrt refuses
them. 📊 **The two listings are now identical in length, 1,467 lines each — `.wat` 954/954, `.wasm`
513/513, nothing in one and not the other.** ⚠️ The fix is *ask later*, not *refuse a forward
reference*: a forward `(type N)` whose inline signature agrees with what lands at N is legal and
wasm-tools assembles it. 🔒 The out-of-range hand-off is kept — `(func (type 5))` with no types
assembles on both and is refused by both at decode.

### 3.2 When the gate runs

| rule | status |
| --- | --- |
| the gate runs on a `will_execute` predicate; a pure **summarize/inspect** path is never gated | ✅ **AGREED** |
| the gate runs **BEFORE validation** — authorization first, so an unauthorized module is refused as *unauthorized* rather than parsed and reported on | ✅ **AGREED** |

### 3.3 The pin DB — a SHARED ON-DISK ARTIFACT

| item | agreed value |
| --- | --- |
| **location** | ✅ **DECIDED (owner, 2026-09-19) — v18. THE SHARED DEPLOYMENT PATH:** `/etc/wasmtk/pins` · `C:\ProgramData\wasmtk\pins`, named for the deployment both runtimes ship inside, **with each runtime's own path kept as a FALLBACK**, and — 🔒 **the part that carries the safety** — **a loud warning when a runtime finds no DB where its sibling would have found one**, instead of quietly computing `armed = false`. ✅ Implemented in wasmrt (T9e), as a pure function with a mutation-verified test. ⏳ **wazmrt to adopt the same order and the same warning** — Track B-b. Today wazmrt reads `C:\ProgramData\wazmrt\pins` only |
| ownership | **root-owned, read-only to the user, plaintext.** Integrity from **ownership, not secrecy** |
| format | one lowercase-hex SHA-256 per line; blank lines and `#` lines ignored; whitespace-separated text after the hash is a human label and is ignored |
| addressing | **content-addressed — no paths in the DB**, so moving or renaming an approved file does not re-open a hole |
| policy directive | `# mode: off\|warn\|enforce` — the policy inherits the DB file's **ownership** |
| pinning time | at **install** time, with privilege — a verified install, **not** TOFU |
| no encryption | a category error: encryption gives confidentiality; what is needed is integrity |
| no machine-binding | the attacker **is** the user |

✅ **RESOLVED 2026-09-19 by the owner — v18, and this closes §5 decision #1, the row this file has
called its most dangerous since v1.** Shared path, per-runtime fallback, and the anti-silent-disarm
warning. wasmrt reads `/etc/wasmtk/pins`, then `/etc/wasmrt/pins`, and **if neither exists while
`/etc/wazmrt/pins` does, it says so** rather than treating the deployment as unarmed.

🎯 **The warning is the load-bearing half, and it is worth being explicit about why.** A shared path
alone would still fail silently the moment a deployment is part-migrated: the binary swaps, the DB is
at the sibling's old path, nothing is found, and `armed = false` is a *perfectly ordinary* state with no
error attached to it. **The failure mode is not "no DB" — it is "no DB, and no reason to think that is
wrong."** Detecting the sibling's DB is the only cheap signal that distinguishes *"this host has no pin
policy"* from *"this host has one and I am not reading it."*

⏳ **wazmrt's half, and it is not just a path constant:** the lookup order, and the warning, and a test
that the warning fires. ⚠️ **Adopting only the shared path would be the dangerous partial fix** — it
closes the case where both runtimes are new and leaves the migration window, which is the window an
operator is actually in while swapping binaries.

*The row as it stood:* ⚠️⚠️ **THE PATH IS THE MOST DANGEROUS UNRESOLVED ROW IN THIS FILE.** If each runtime reads its own path,
**swapping the binary finds no DB, computes `armed = false`, and silently runs everything** — a security
downgrade with **no error message**, which is the worst defect class either project tracks.

**RECOMMENDED (owner decision pending): one shared path named for the deployment** —
`/etc/wasmtk/pins` and `C:\ProgramData\wasmtk\pins`, since `wasmtk` is what both are being included in.
Each may keep its own legacy path as a fallback. 🔒 **Whatever is chosen, a swap must not be able to
disarm silently:** if a runtime finds no DB where its sibling would have found one, that is worth saying
out loud rather than treating as "unarmed".

### 3.4 The `decide()` matrix — this must match exactly

Inputs: `explicit` (the DB's `# mode:`, or none) · `pinned` · `opt_out` (`--no-verify`/`--yes`) ·
`tty` · `armed`.

| # | condition | action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `pinned` | **Run** — the DB approved it |
| 2 | `explicit = off` | **Run** |
| 3 | `explicit = enforce` | **Deny — ABSOLUTELY.** `opt_out` and `tty` are ignored: authority comes from the root-owned policy, never from a runtime argument |
| 4 | `explicit = warn`, `opt_out` | **Run** (with a warning printed) |
| 5 | `explicit = warn`, no `opt_out`, `tty` | **Prompt** |
| 6 | `explicit = warn`, no `opt_out`, no `tty` | **Deny** |
| 7 | no `explicit`, **not armed** | **Run** — nothing to verify against |
| 8 | no `explicit`, armed, `opt_out` | **Run** (with a warning printed) |
| 9 | no `explicit`, armed, no `opt_out` | **Deny** |

**Armed** = a root key is embedded **or** a pin DB is present. A bare build with neither runs
everything, so "costs nothing when unarmed" is structural rather than promised.

**`--verify` may only RAISE strictness** above the DB-declared policy, never lower it. **Under a
root-owned `# mode: enforce`, both `--pins` and `--verify` are ignored** — the pin set *and* the policy
come from root.

### 3.5 Fail-closed rules — both bought by defects, both binding

| rule | why |
| --- | --- |
| a present `# mode:` with an **unrecognised value** means **`enforce`**, not "no policy" | a typo (`# mode: enfroce`), odd capitalisation or a trailing comment must not silently degrade to a state `--no-verify` can then override. **A root-intended enforce must never be downgradable by a misspelling.** |
| a DB content line whose first token is **not a valid 64-hex digest** is an **error**, not a skipped line | a truncated or mangled DB must fail **loud**; silently dropping approvals makes a pinned module look "not in the list" — which reads as an attack and hides a corrupt file |
| `--verify <typo>` is an **error**, not a default | same reasoning as the `# mode:` rule, at the other input |
| an override that *would* have blocked **prints a warning** | never silently unverified |

### 3.6 The WASI sandbox rights model

| property | agreed value | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PATH_SYMLINK` exists as a right | **bit 24** | ✅ **AGREED** (wazmrt had **no such right at all** until 2026-08-10 — the gap that started this table) |
| `PATH_SYMLINK` is in the **write mask** | yes, so `--ro-dir` strips it | ✅ **AGREED** |
| `--dir` grants | `ALL & !PATH_SYMLINK` — **symlink CREATION denied by default** | ✅ **AGREED** (owner, 2026-08-10) |
| `--ro-dir` grants | `ALL & !WRITE_MASK` | ✅ **AGREED** |
| `--allow-symlink` | opts creation back in, for installer-shaped work | ✅ **AGREED** |
| following a **pre-existing** link | allowed — the grant governs **creation**, not traversal | ✅ **AGREED** |
| an escaping link target | refused **at creation**, independently of the follow-time check | ✅ **AGREED** |
| no `--dir` at all | every path call is `BADF`; **there is no implicit cwd** | ✅ **AGREED** |
| the full `oflags`/`fdflags` sets, and which right each `path_*` handler demands | ⬜ **UNVERIFIED** — this is the T12x row-by-row diff, still to be run |

### 3.7 Resource ceilings

| ceiling | default | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| max linear memory | **`1 << 30`** (1 GiB) | ✅ **AGREED** — verified in both, 2026-08-19 |
| max table elements | **`1 << 27`** (128 M) | ✅ **AGREED** — verified in both, 2026-08-19 |
| max call depth | **512** | ✅ **AGREED** — verified in both, 2026-08-19 |
| an execution bound (non-termination) | **`1 << 30` iterations** per top-level call | ⚠️⚠️ **DIVERGENT AND LIVE — wazmrt shipped it 2026-08-19, wasmrt has nothing. See §3.7a.** |

### 3.7a The execution bound — ✅ **CLOSED 2026-09-19 (v19): BOTH runtimes implement it, verified by running both. The UNIT matters more than the number**

🔒 **Owner decision, 2026-08-19** (this resolves §5 decision #3): *"We do not want an infinite loop on
purpose or by accident by the user. We need an internal check mechanism if this occurs and an error
message to the user with a break on occurrence."*

⚠️ **PROCESS NOTE, RECORDED RATHER THAN TIDIED AWAY: wazmrt shipped this BEFORE the contract carried
it, which §1 rule 1 forbids** (*"a change is proposed in one repo and lands in both … before either
ships behaviour that depends on it"*). The behaviour was built in wazmrt's Track zH3 while this row
still read *"neither has one"*. Nothing about the design is retracted — the owner asked for it — but
the ordering was wrong, and this row is the correction, not the announcement.

**Verified by RUNNING both on the SAME BYTES** (§1 rule 4), 2026-08-19 — one `.wasm` assembled by
wasmrt's own `wasmrt wat`, containing `(loop (br 0))` and `(func $f (return_call $f))`:

| runtime | `spin` (loop) | `tailspin` (tail call) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **wazmrt** | traps `IterationLimitExceeded`, exit 1 | traps `IterationLimitExceeded`, exit 1 |
| **wasmrt** | ⚠️ **hung** (killed at 10 s) | ⚠️ **hung** (killed at 10 s) |

**So a module that returns an error under one runtime hangs the host under the other. That is the
swappability break §5 decision #3 predicted, and it is live today.**

✅ **CLOSED 2026-09-19 — wasmrt landed the bound in T9i, and the pen-holder VERIFIED IT BY RUNNING
BOTH rather than accepting the report** (§1 rule 4). One `.wasm` containing `(loop (br 0))` and
`(func $f (return_call $f))`, both runtimes, same bytes, `--max-iterations 1000000`:

| | `spin` (back-edge) | `tailspin` (tail call) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **wazmrt** | ✅ `trap: IterationLimitExceeded`, rc 1 | ✅ `trap: IterationLimitExceeded`, rc 1 |
| **wasmrt** | ✅ `trap: iteration limit exceeded`, rc 1 | ✅ `trap: iteration limit exceeded`, rc 1 |

**Both message rows are met on both sides** — each names the ceiling that was hit and how to raise it,
and neither claims to have detected an infinite loop. **The differential table that opened this section
— wazmrt trapping, wasmrt hanging — is now green in every cell.** §5 decision #5 closes.

🔬 **wasmrt re-measured the default on its own corpus rather than adopting the number on trust**, which
is exactly what this section asked for: green at `1<<20`; at `1<<19` `return_call.wast` and
`return_call_ref.wast` fail; at `1<<18` `return_call_indirect` joins them; 36 failures at `1<<14`.
✅ **Same shape as wazmrt's descent** — the heaviest legitimate workload is the million-hop chain in both
— so the two engines agree about where the floor is, and `1<<30` is ~1000x the measured peak on both.
🎓 *Two independent measurements landing on the same shape is what makes `1<<30` a measured default
rather than a shared guess.*

⚠️ **THE C ABI TAKES `0` AS "LEAVE THE DEFAULT", NOT "UNLIMITED" — and the asymmetry with the CLI is
deliberate on wasmrt's side.** A library embedder must not remove the bound by passing zero, which is
what every other ceiling setter already means; a person at their own terminal may, via
`--max-iterations 0`. 📌 **RECOMMENDED for wazmrt where it exposes the bound through its own C API** —
this is an ABI-surface convention rather than a CLI row, and §0 keeps the C ABI out of scope, so it is
recorded as a **strong recommendation, not a binding row**. ⚠️ **If wazmrt chooses the other
convention, that is permitted and must be DOCUMENTED**, because an embedder porting between the two C
APIs would otherwise disarm a ceiling by writing the same zero.

🎓 **A LESSON FROM VERIFYING THIS, and it sharpens §4 checks 6 and 7.** The pen-holder's first run put
`--max-iterations` **after the export name** — a guest position — so it never applied; the run then
exited **rc 1** anyway, from an argument-count error. ⚠️⚠️ **An `rc != 0` assertion would have recorded
that as the bound working.** zH7's warning is the only reason it was caught. **So a differential check on
the bound must assert the TRAP, not merely a non-zero exit** — and must place the flag in a host
position, which differs between the two CLIs. *The check that only reads the exit code passes for the
wrong reason, which is worse than failing.*

#### The agreed design — what wasmrt must implement to close it

| item | agreed value | why it is in the contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **the unit — ONE ITERATION** | **one loop back-edge, OR one tail-call hop** | 🎯 **THIS IS THE ROW THAT MATTERS.** Two runtimes with "a limit of `1<<30`" that COUNT DIFFERENT THINGS are not swappable: a module finishing just under the ceiling on one traps on the other. Aligning the number while leaving the unit unstated would look like agreement and behave like divergence. **Counting instructions instead of back-edges is a contract breach even at the same number.** |
| **default** | **`1 << 30`** (1,073,741,824) | measured, not chosen — see below |
| **scope of the budget** | **per top-level invocation**, refilled on entry | so a long-running host loop calling many short guest functions is never starved |
| **re-entry** | a host callback calling back in **inherits the remainder**; it does NOT refill | a guest that can refill its budget by bouncing through a host function does not have a budget |
| **what happens** | a **trap** — an ordinary trap on the runtime's normal trap path | not an abort, not a process exit |
| **CLI flag** | `--max-iterations <count>`, in the **leading run of host flags** (§2.4) | position is part of the flag contract, not a detail |
| **`0` at the CLI** | **unlimited** | |
| **the message** | must state the **ceiling that was hit** and **how to raise it** | |
| **what it must NOT claim** | it bounds non-termination; it does **not** detect an infinite loop | a legitimately long-running module trips the same trap, and its owner needs to be told to raise the ceiling — not told a falsehood about their program |
| **a count, NOT a clock** | binding | a wall-clock deadline makes the same module trap on a slow machine and pass on a fast one — the two runtimes would then disagree *by machine*, which is unswappable by construction. It also cannot be enforced without a thread and a clock, which the freestanding target does not have. |

⚠️ **Why the tail-call tick is called out separately: a back-edge counter alone looks complete and is
not.** A local `return_call` reuses the interpreter's native frame *by design*, so it makes no backward
branch and grows no call depth — the call-depth ceiling cannot see it either. `(func $f (return_call
$f))` runs forever under a back-edge-only design. **Both runtimes recurse natively for `call` and both
implement tail calls, so this applies to both.** ⚠️ It is also the tick whose absence is invisible to an
obvious test: delete it and the loop test still passes.

**The default is measured, and the method transfers** — run the spec corpus at descending budgets until
it breaks. wazmrt's result (284 files): green at `1<<20`; at `1<<18` **only** `return_call`,
`return_call_indirect`, `return_call_ref` fail; at `1<<14`, 36 failures across 8 files. The heaviest
legitimate workload in the suite is `return_call.wast`'s **million-hop chain**, which fits under `1<<20`
with under 5% to spare — so `1<<30` is ~1000x the measured peak. ⚠️ **wasmrt should re-run this against
its own corpus rather than adopting the number on trust**; if its peak differs materially, that is a
finding about one of the two engines and belongs in §4 as an observation.

⚠️ **Keep the new error OUT of the "is this a spec trap?" predicate** in the `.wast` runner (wazmrt:
`isRuntimeTrap`). An engine resource cap must not satisfy an `assert_trap` meant for real trapping
behaviour — and excluding it has a second payoff: **the conformance corpus becomes a live gate on the
ceiling**, failing loudly when the budget is set too low instead of banking the timeout as the expected
trap. That is what made the measurement above possible.

**REOPEN / CLOSE CONDITION:** this row becomes ✅ AGREED when wasmrt ships the bound with the same unit
and default, and the differential table above is re-run with both trapping. **Until then a deployment
that swaps wasmrt in loses the protection silently** — there is no error, the workload simply never
returns. *(Same failure shape as the pin-DB path risk in §3.3: a swap that disarms without saying so.)*

#### Where each side tracks the work

| project | item | state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **wazmrt** | Track **zH3** (hardening, ships as `1.0.1`) | ✅ **built 2026-08-19** — `--max-iterations`, `IterationLimitExceeded`, 4 tests covering both shapes + the no-false-positive and refill directions; corpus descent measured; cost exe +1,024 B / lib +512 B / **dll +0** |
| **wasmrt** | **T9i** (ships as `1.0.1`) | ✅ decided, `[ ]` not yet built — owner: *"3 has already been decided in the wazmrt project, just follow their lead"* |

✅ **The two designs were written independently and agree** — `u64::MAX` filled at refill for
"unlimited", the two `0` conventions, the trap excluded from the `.wast` runner's spec-trap predicate,
the refill/re-entry rule, and the message wording. That agreement is *evidence the contract is
specific enough to build from*, which is the only thing this file is for.

⚠️ **wasmrt's plan caught a real gap on wazmrt's side, which is this file working as intended.** T9i
requires **A/B/A throughput benchmarking** around the change, because wasmrt has a recorded case
(T9a#7) of threading state through the same interpreter loop costing **3.6%**. wazmrt had measured only
SIZE (+1,024 B exe, +512 B lib, **+0 dll**).

✅ **wazmrt has since run it, and the cost is real: ~3% on a tight loop.** A/B/A on the steady bench
(`sum(1e6)` ×50, ReleaseFast), removing and restoring both tick sites: **34.29 → 33.45 → 34.62
ns/loop-iter** (233 → 239 → 231 Mops/s). A-to-A spread is ~1%, so the ~3% A-vs-B gap is above this
box's noise but close enough to it that **B is a single sample and deserves a repeat**. The tick sits
in the hottest loop in the program and the bench is dominated by back-edges, so this is close to a
worst case rather than a typical one.

📌 **Recorded for wasmrt's planning, NOT as a contract row — §0 puts performance explicitly out of
scope**, and no row may be justified by what the other one measured. **Expect a few percent; it is not
a defect.** ⚠️ **But one performance response WOULD be a contract change:** amortizing the tick to
every *N*th back-edge alters the **granularity of the unit**, so the same ceiling would stop meaning
the same thing on both sides. Neither project may do that unilaterally.

## 4. The differential checks that keep this honest

⚠️ *Two implementations of one spec are a free differential oracle; not using them against each other is
the waste.* These checks are the contract's only real enforcement — a row marked ✅ that nothing re-runs
decays exactly like any other claim.

| # | check | catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **byte-compare the two copies of this file** | the drift hazard in §1 — the one failure that makes every other row meaningless |
| 2 | **assemble the shared `.wat` corpus with both, diff the SHA-256 of the outputs** | ⚠️ a pinned `.wat` that validates under one runtime and is refused by the other. **Not hypothetical** — wasmrt has four recorded defects where its emitter produced a different module than the text described. If the assemblers disagree, **only `.wasm` digests are portable** and that must be documented, not discovered |
| 3 | **run the same pin DB + the same module under both**, across all nine `decide()` rows | a policy that is honoured *differently*, which is worse than not being honoured |
| 4 | **row-by-row diff of the WASI rights tables** (§3.6) | the original finding that opened this file: a right present in one and absent in the other, where the read-only test passes trivially because the right is not in the mask |
| 5 | **the same CLI invocation under both**, for every row of §2 | the `--dir` separator class — a flag that does not error and does the wrong thing |
| 6 | ⚠️ **UPDATED v19 — assert the TRAP, not merely a non-zero exit, and place the flag in each CLI's own host position.** The pen-holder's first run of this check put `--max-iterations` after the export name, where it was guest argv and never applied; the run exited **1** anyway from an argument-count error, so an `rc != 0` assertion would have recorded the bound as working. · **run a non-terminating module under both, under a timeout** — one `.wasm` containing `(loop (br 0))` **and** `(func $f (return_call $f))`, both shapes, both runtimes, low `--max-iterations` | §3.7a. ⚠️ **Must be run under a timeout and must assert the EXIT, not the output**: the failing side produces no output at all, so a check that greps stdout passes vacuously against a hung process. The two shapes are separate cases on purpose — a back-edge-only implementation passes the first and hangs on the second |
| 7 | **the same module at a budget just under and just over its true cost**, both runtimes | that both count the SAME UNIT (§3.7a). Equal defaults with different units disagree only near the ceiling, which is exactly where nobody looks |
| 8 | 🆕 **an unknown flag in EVERY host-flag position under both** — first argument, before the path, the leading run after the path, and a `.wast`/`wat` invocation — **and in the guest positions, asserting it is UNTOUCHED** (§2.4a, v11, **as narrowed by v15**) | ⚠️ the Z2 class: a mistyped host flag that vanishes into the guest's argv. **The negative half is the load-bearing half** — a check that only asserts the error will be "fixed" by a parser that errors on the guest's own `-la`, which v15 explicitly permits and `prog.wasm install --yes` explicitly forbids. 🆕 **Run the dash-count cases in BOTH mode families** (`_start` present and absent): the single-dash carve-out applies only where there is guest argv, so a check that uses one module shape will bless the wrong behaviour in the other |
| 9 | 🆕 **summarize an INVALID module under both and grep EVERY output line for a validity claim** (§2.5, v12) | ⚠️ the Z3 class. **Assert on the whole output, not the exit code** — the exit code was already right on both sides when Z3 was found, so a check that reads only `rc` passes vacuously against the exact defect it is named for |
| 11 | 🆕 **a position-restricted flag written in the WRONG host position, under both** — and, separately, in a guest position asserting it is untouched (§2.4b, v16) | ⚠️ the silent-drop class on a flag that RESTRICTS. **Assert the exit status, not the message**: the failure mode being guarded is a **successful** run that ignored the flag, so a check that greps stderr for wording passes vacuously against a build that dropped the flag and said nothing |
| 10 | 🆕 **name an export the module does not have, under both, on every call form** (§2.3 Z1 row, v13) | ⚠️ the Z1/F1 class, and it is **live on both sides today** — wazmrt's bare path and wasmrt's bare path both exit 0. **Every call form** is deliberate: wasmrt's `run` passes this and its bare path fails it, so a one-form check would have reported the project compliant |

⚠️ **A disagreement found by any of these is recorded as an OBSERVATION until its cause is traced.**
Neither runtime is the oracle, so "the other one does X" is not a diagnosis.

## 5. Owner decisions this file is waiting on

| # | decision | why it blocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ~~1~~ | ~~**The shared pin DB path** (§3.3)~~ | ✅ **DECIDED by the owner 2026-09-19 and FOLDED IN AS v18** — the shared `wasmtk` path, per-runtime fallback, **and a loud warning when a runtime finds no DB where its sibling would have found one.** 🎓 *This file's most dangerous row since v1, and what closed it was not the path but the warning.* ✅ wasmrt implements it (T9e, mutation-verified); ⏳ **wazmrt to adopt the order AND the warning** — Track B-b. ⚠️ **REOPEN if either side ships the path without the warning**, which is the partial fix that leaves the migration window open |
| ~~2~~ | ~~**Who accepts whose CLI spelling, and by when** (§2.1)~~ | ✅ **CONFIRMED by the owner 2026-09-20 — and wasmrt is SYNCING ITS CLI TO wazmrt'S.** wazmrt's half landed in B-c4 (`run`/`wasi`/`wat`/`wast`, both `--dir` separators); the sibling adopting the rest closes the additive plan. ⚠️ **The ⬜ rows in `roadmap.md`'s §2.1 tables were stale when this was decided** — they still read "not started" for four capabilities that shipped; corrected the same day |
| ~~3~~ | ~~**Fuel / execution bound** (§3.7)~~ | ✅ **DECIDED by the owner 2026-08-19** — a bound is wanted, with an error message and a break. Design agreed in **§3.7a**. ⚠️ **The decision is closed; the DIVERGENCE is open**: wazmrt ships it, wasmrt does not, and the predicted failure ("a workload that completes under one hangs under the other") is **verified live**, not hypothetical |
| ~~5~~ | ~~**When does wasmrt land the execution bound** (§3.7a)~~ | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-09-19 — wasmrt shipped it (T9i), FOLDED IN AS v19**, and the pen-holder re-verified by running both on the same bytes: all four cells trap, `rc 1`, both messages naming the ceiling and how to raise it. Defaults independently re-measured on each corpus to the same shape. ⚠️ **REOPEN if either side amortizes the tick to every *N*th back-edge** — that changes the UNIT's granularity, and the ceiling stops meaning the same thing on both sides |
| ~~6~~ | ~~**Attribution of commit `c9c447f3` (was `7ce0dcd2`) in the wasmrt repo**~~ | ✅ **CONFIRMED by the owner 2026-09-20** — the record stands as written and the matter is closed on wazmrt's side. 🔒 Nothing for an agent to do here and nothing to reopen: **wazmrt does not write to that tree**, and the owner carries anything that needs carrying. *(Original entry: )* wasmrt reports it committed **wazmrt's** §3.7a rewrite into its tree as if it were its own, before the collision was noticed. ⚠️ **wazmrt cannot fix this — §1a forbids writing to that tree**, and rewriting another repo's history is not an agent's call anyway. It is exactly the tracking-integrity problem the boundary was added to prevent, and it is now **behind** the rule rather than in front of it. Options: leave it with the collision documented in row 3b, or have the wasmrt session amend/annotate it **in its own tree** |
| ~~7~~ | ~~**Whether coordination should run in ONE session at a time** (§1c)~~ | ✅ **DECIDED by the owner 2026-09-20: YES — coordination runs ONE SESSION AT A TIME.** 🔒 **And the owner restated the boundary alongside it: *"we do not modify the other project unless specifically requested."*** That is §1a unchanged and now doubly stated — one session removes the same-copy last-write-wins race, and the write ban removes the cross-tree one. ⚠️ **"Specifically requested" means the owner, for a named edit.** `coordinate` is still an order to CONFER, never a licence to write. *(Original entry: )* §1a removes the cross-tree risk by construction, but two sessions editing the *same* copy still resolve last-write-wins with nothing to detect it. wasmrt proposed the discipline; it costs nothing and closes the residual gap |
| ~~4~~ | ~~**Exit-code table** (§2.3)~~ | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-09-19 by MEASUREMENT rather than by a decision — v13.** Both runtimes already return `1` for every host-side failure kind and every trap (§2.3m, plus the pen-holder's own re-run); §2.3 row 3 is now ✅ AGREED and no table is needed. 🎓 *The decision had been waiting on the owner for a month for want of somebody running twelve commands.* ⚠️ **REOPEN if either side ever emits a second non-zero code.** |
| ~~8~~ | ~~**Unknown flags**~~ (§2.4a) | ✅ **DECIDED by the owner 2026-09-19** and ✅ **FOLDED IN AS v11** by the pen-holder the same day: an error saying `unknown flag`, rc 1, in every host-flag position. wasmrt complies (re-verified by running it); **wazmrt to adopt — tracked at Track B-b.** |
| ~~10~~ | ~~**Does v14's "no looks like" reach flag VALUES — the `--dir` drive-letter fallback?**~~ (§2.2, §2.4a-i) | ✅ **DECIDED by the owner 2026-09-21 and SHIPPED THE SAME DAY as v27 — and none of the three costed options was the answer.** 🔑 **The host half of `--dir` now has a GRAMMAR: a relative path must start with `./` or `../`, and a bare `data` is an ERROR.** Once `data` is not a legal spelling, a leading `<letter>:` can only *be* a drive — **grammar, not resemblance** — so v14 is satisfied with the heuristic deleted rather than exchanged. 🎓 *The row was open two days over which spelling to guess; it closed by removing the spelling that forced the guess.* ⚠️ **The escape already existed and already worked** — `./q:/m` split correctly before any of this was written, which is why the fix cost a restriction and not a new rule. 🚨 **AND THE ROW HID A SECOND DEFECT: the drive rule had NO PLATFORM BRANCH and both POSIX targets cross-compile clean**, so a drive-letter heuristic was shipping to Linux and macOS, where there are no drives and `\` is an ordinary filename byte. Now gated — see the §2.2 row. **Breaking:** `--dir data:/m` and `--dir q::/m` must become `./data:/m` and `./q::/m`; `C:` and `C:Users` are drive-relative errors instead of `FileNotFound` |
| ~~11~~ | ~~**Should zH7's WARN become an ERROR?**~~ (§2.2 position row, §2.4a-i) | ✅ **DECIDED by the owner 2026-09-20: YES, IT ERRORS.** ✅ **wazmrt shipped it the same day** — `misplacedHostFlag` + `reportMisplacedHostFlag` replace `warnMisplacedFlags`; `rc 1`, the message names both correct spellings, **byte-neutral in ReleaseSmall** (all three ceilings unmoved). ⏳ **PENDING MIRROR — wasmrt's §2.2 row still says WARN.** 🎓 The code argued *"warn, do not refuse, because a guest may legitimately take `--dir`"* — **and was wrong about its own escape hatch**: that case already had an exact spelling, `tool.wasm build -- --dir src`, which the walk always honoured. *A rule protecting a case the grammar can already express protects nothing; it only defers the ambiguity to whoever reads the output.* 🚨 **BUT THE ROW'S OBJECTION WAS REAL AND IS NOW LIVE — see §2.4a-ii below.** *(Original entry: )* a *known* host flag in a *guest* position warns today, because it may genuinely be the guest's. v14 does not reach it — the host/guest split is **grammar, not resemblance** — but it is the rule's nearest neighbour. ⚠️ **Erroring would break `prog.wasm install --yes`**, which §2.4 says must reach the guest untouched, so this is a real trade and not a tightening |
| ~~12~~ | ~~**§2.4a-ii — zH7-as-error CONTRADICTS §2.4a's "guest positions are never examined". Which text wins?**~~ | ✅ **DECIDED by the owner 2026-09-21: (a), AMEND THE RULE — folded in as v28.** §2.4a now says what the code does: only what follows `--` is never examined; after the first non-flag argument, EXACT wazmrt flag names are an error and everything else passes verbatim. **No code change** — the behaviour shipped with #11. ✅ **Re-verified by running** the day it was decided: `install --yes` rc 1; `install --yess`, `install --Yes`, `install --dirs` and `install -- --yes` all rc 0. *(Original entry:)* 🔬 **MEASURED after shipping #11, not predicted:** `wazmrt prog.wasm install --yes` now **errors, rc 1**. §2.4a says a guest's argv *"is not addressed to wazmrt at all"* and is never examined; §2.4 records the `install --yes` trap as the reason. ⚠️ **Both cannot stand as written.** 🎓 The honest framing: §2.4a's "never examined" **was already not literally true** — zH7 warned about exactly these tokens since 2026-08-19. #11 changed the VERDICT, not the examination, and that is what made the contradiction visible. **Three ways out, for the owner:** **(a)** accept it — `install -- --yes` becomes the only spelling, and §2.4a is amended to say guest positions are examined for EXACT host-flag names; **(b)** restrict the error to the fail-OPEN flags (`--verify`, `--pins`, `--max-*`) and keep warning for the rest, which splits on the harm rather than on the grammar; **(c)** revert #11. 📌 **Recommendation: (a).** It is the only one that leaves a single rule, the escape hatch is exact, and (b) reintroduces a list that drifts — the failure mode v14 exists to prevent |
| ~~9~~ | ~~**Truthful validity claims in output (Z3)**~~ (§2.5) | ✅ **DECIDED by the owner 2026-09-19** and ✅ **FOLDED IN AS v12** by the pen-holder the same day: in scope as the one output-text exception (§0). wasmrt complies (re-verified); **wazmrt to adopt — tracked at Track B-b.** |

## 6. Change log

| version | date | change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **33** ⏳ | 2026-10-23 | 🔒 **Three changes.**<br>**(1) RELEASE LOCKSTEP ENDED** (owner: *"we are officially out of lock step now due to differences"*). §1e is marked ended and kept as the record. The contract rows and the §1a mirror rule stay; only the joint-release rule goes.<br>**(2) v32 covers MEANINGS too** (owner: *"aligning with binaryang means its meanings also"*), answering wasmrt's §2.2m question: gating per instruction follows D1's `feature` column, and the rules follow D2.<br>**(3) wasmrt's §2.2f and §2.2m annexes FOLDED verbatim**, at the place wasmrt put them. Both copies were byte-identical at the fold (v32 + both annexes), before this version's edits.<br>From §2.2m's notes for the pen holder, **re-measured on wazmrt 1.0.4**:<br>• `(table i64 …)` under `all,-memory64` was still ADMITTED where wasm-tools refuses: a real gating defect in wazmrt. ✅ **FIXED the same day** (owner: "fix the 64-bit table issue now"). A 64-bit table now needs `memory64`, as in wasm-tools. It is kind 4 (accepting less), so wazmrt's next release is a major unless the owner calls otherwise (`known-issues.md`).<br>• `call_ref` under `all,-function-references` with GC on is still admitted. A semantics question that the D2 migration settles.<br>• The table initializer with function-references and GC off is now REFUSED: fixed.<br>• The wasm-tools 1.262 oracle drift is moot, because the row is moving to D2.<br>⏳ **Still for the pen holder:** the stale wasmrt cells §2.2m lists (§2.1 `pin`, and §2.2 `--env` / `--max-*` / `--` / `--pins` / `--verify` / `--no-verify` / `--features` marked "absent"), to refresh after re-running them.<br>⏳ **PENDING MIRROR.** |
| **32** ⏳ | 2026-10-23 | 🔒 **OWNER: "we need to align with binaryang not wasm-tools."** v30 made `--features` take wasm-tools' whole vocabulary with its meanings. The owner reverses that direction. **binaryang's D2** (the workspace's shared feature list, `../../cmem/divergences.md` § "The shared definitions") becomes the canonical vocabulary, and the wasm-tools-only names (`floats`, `gc-types`, `legacy-exceptions`, `bulk-memory-opt`, `call-indirect-overlong`, `mutable-global`) stay as **deprecated aliases for one minor release**, then go in a major. The C ABI's `wazmrt_feature_t` APPENDS and renumbers nothing. **Record-only today**: wazmrt's behaviour is unchanged, and the §2.2 row is rewritten when binaryang's FL1 settles D2's `cli` spellings, so both runtimes migrate once. ⚠️ **wasmrt (at v10): do NOT implement v30's wasm-tools vocabulary in the meantime.** ⏳ **PENDING MIRROR.** |
| **31** ⏳ | 2026-10-23 | **wasmrt rewrote its history (workspace letter H19, drive paths only), so the wasmrt commit ids this file quoted are OLD.** Each is replaced by its new id with the old one kept once in brackets, so older records still resolve: `c9c447f3` (was `7ce0dcd2`, §5 #6 and its change-log rows), `ff99f6f1` (was `ab13ba975`), `4e3de996` (was `51254b9cf`), `da17c367` (was `3c49845dd`). Every pair read from `wasmrt/cmem/history-map-2026-10-23.md` (letter H21). Record-only: no contract row changes meaning. ⏳ **PENDING MIRROR** — wasmrt's copy needs the same ids. 🔒 Standing rule: a sibling's commit id is looked up in that sibling's history map before it is quoted. |
| **30** ⏳ | 2026-09-21 | 🔒 **OWNER: EVERY wasm-tools FEATURE NAME, WITH wasm-tools' SEMANTICS — "the broadest compatibility", component-model names included, legacy exceptions built in.** §2.2's `--features` row. 🔬 **Every rule MEASURED, not read**: `cmem/probes/feature-matrix.ts` validates one minimal module per feature under every preset, every single name, the minimal pairs, the group names and per-instruction cases — and **the identical matrix run against wazmrt now matches wasm-tools on every row**. Findings that changed the design: `mvp` ≠ `wasm1` (wasm-tools' `--help` says otherwise); `externref` needs `gc-types`; typed references need `reference-types` too; relaxed-SIMD ops are NOT float-gated; `bulk-memory`/`reference-types` are group names in both directions; **wasm-tools never refuses a CONFIGURATION**, so wazmrt's "incoherent config" refusal is retired and each dependency is enforced on the MODULE instead. 🚨 **Three wazmrt defects found on the way**: a plain `funcref` TABLE was refused under `--features mvp` (shipped in 1.0.2 — every C program with a function pointer); function LOCALS were never feature-checked (`(local v128)` ran under `mvp`); `opcode.freeBody` leaked `try_table`'s catch list. C ABI: `WAZMRT_FEATURE_*` 19–24 added; `wazmrt_config_all_features(false)` keeps floats ON, so it still means "WebAssembly 1.0". ⏳ **PENDING MIRROR** — and §2.2's wasmrt `--features` cell ("absent") is contradicted by measurement. |
| **29** ⏳ | 2026-09-21 | 🚨 **§3.1 `.wat` PIN PORTABILITY IS BROKEN ON PURPOSE, and the fix that breaks it is the right one.** Workspace letter H13: both runtimes' module bodies diverged from **wasm-tools** in three legal-but-different ways — **I12** one local group per local, **I13** module-level exports moved after inline ones, **I14** every signature interned before any block type. 🎓 *They hid because the Z4 gate compared the runtimes to EACH OTHER: two implementations agreeing is not two implementations being right.* wazmrt fixed all three in `1.0.2` (`9aee871d1`, inversion-proven, 528/528 bodies equal wasm-tools'). Measured against wasmrt's 2026-09-20 build: `.wat` pins now agree on **64/528**, down from 528. ⏳ **PENDING wasmrt's matching fix and this file's mirror.** ⚠️ **Two of the letter's diagnoses were off, recorded so wasmrt fixes the CAUSE:** I13 is not "grouped by kind" — deferred `(export …)` forms were appended after every inline export; I14 is not a tag — wasm-tools interns function by function (`probes/i14-interleave.wat` shows it in two functions). 🔒 Owner: ships as `1.0.2`, *"since the consumers are not involved yet"*. |
| **28** ⏳ | 2026-09-21 | 🔒 **TWO OWNER DECISIONS.** **(1) §5 #12 CLOSED: §2.4a is AMENDED to match the code.** Guest positions after the first non-flag argument are examined for **exact** wazmrt flag names, and a match is an error; only what follows `--` is never examined. `prog.wasm install -- --yes` is the spelling. Verified by running: exact `--yes` rc 1; `--yess`, `--Yes`, `--dirs` and `-- --yes` rc 0. 🎓 *A rule is amended to describe the code when the code is the decision; the "never examined" text had been false since 2026-08-19.* **(2) §1e REVISED: wazmrt `1.0.2` SHIPS BEFORE wasmrt reaches `1.0.1`** — the 1.0.1 rendezvous recorded the same morning is superseded; see §1e for what that leaves open. ⏳ **PENDING MIRROR.** |
| **27** ⏳ | 2026-09-21 | 🔒 **OWNER: THE `--dir` HOST HALF HAS A GRAMMAR, AND §5 #10 IS CLOSED — the heuristic is DELETED, not exchanged.** Accepted: `./p` `../p` `.` `..` `/p`, plus `<letter>:/p`, `<letter>:\p`, `\\srv\share` **on Windows only**. A **bare relative** path (`data`) and a **drive-relative** one (`C:`, `C:Users`) are syntax errors, reported **before the filesystem is touched** — v14's rule is that a malformed argument throws, and a typo coming back as `FileNotFound` sends the user to the filesystem to debug a spelling. 🔑 **Why this closes a row that had three costed options and no good one:** once `data` is illegal, `<letter>:` can only be a drive, so the resemblance rule is unnecessary rather than tolerated. **The owner's framing was "the same semantics TypeScript accepts"; the measured answer was a STRICTER SUBSET of it** — Node does not validate paths, it *resolves* them (`path.resolve("data")` succeeds), so literal parity would have re-admitted the exact spelling that caused the ambiguity. 🚨 **A SECOND DEFECT, found while gating the first and never suspected: `splitPreopen` had NO platform branch**, and `x86_64-linux-gnu` + `aarch64-macos` both cross-compile clean — a drive-letter rule was shipping to platforms with no drives, where `\` is an ordinary filename byte. The platform is now a **parameter**, not a read of `builtin`, so **both matrices are under unit test from either host** (806/810 passing, +2). ⚠️ **What that does NOT buy: wazmrt has still never been RUN on POSIX** — no CI exists in this repo at all, and `wasi.zig`'s `isAbsoluteTarget` / `escapesRelative` still split on `\` and read `t[1] == ':'` as drive-qualified on every platform. Reading says those are fail-CLOSED (they over-refuse legal POSIX names rather than granting access); that is a reading, not a measurement, and it is the open item. 🩹 **Also shipped: a Git Bash diagnostic.** MSYS rewrites `--dir ./data:/m` to `.\data;M:\` before wazmrt sees a byte (measured against three shells; PowerShell and cmd pass argv verbatim), so the corrupted path in the error read as a wazmrt bug. A `;` in a failing spec now adds a note naming the cause. **`::` is the only separator MSYS leaves alone**, so `--help` now prints `.::/` — which is also wasmrt's preferred spelling, so the fix moved toward the contract rather than away. 📐 Size gate: exe **+2,048**, lib +22, dll +0, ceilings raised in the same commit. ⏳ **PENDING MIRROR — and for the first time it runs the other way, with wazmrt the stricter side.** ⚠️ wasmrt's actual behaviour here is **UNMEASURED**; the check is in the §2.2 row. |
| **26** ⏳ | 2026-09-20 | 🔒 **FOUR OWNER DECISIONS, AND THE CLI QUESTION IS CLOSED FROM BOTH ENDS.** **§5 #2 CONFIRMED — and wasmrt is SYNCING ITS CLI TO wazmrt's**, which finishes the additive plan (wazmrt's half landed in B-c4). **§5 #6 CONFIRMED** — the `c9c447f3` (was `7ce0dcd2`) attribution record stands; nothing for an agent to do, since wazmrt does not write to that tree. **§5 #7 DECIDED: coordination runs ONE SESSION AT A TIME**, with the boundary restated by the owner — *"we do not modify the other project unless specifically requested"*, §1a unchanged and now doubly stated. **§5 #11 DECIDED: zH7 ERRORS** — ✅ wazmrt shipped it the same day (`misplacedHostFlag`, `rc 1`, byte-neutral in ReleaseSmall). 🚨 **AND SHIPPING IT OPENED §5 #12, MEASURED RATHER THAN PREDICTED:** `wazmrt prog.wasm install --yes` now errors, which **contradicts §2.4a's "guest positions are never examined"** and the `install --yes` case §2.4 records. The old #11 row called that trade and was right. 🎓 §2.4a's "never examined" was **already not literally true** — zH7 warned about these same tokens from 2026-08-19; #11 changed the verdict, not the examination, and that is what made the contradiction visible. Three ways out are written into §5 #12 with a recommendation. ⚠️ **§5 #10 IS STILL OPEN** — whether v14's "no looks like" reaches flag VALUES, i.e. `--dir`'s drive-letter fallback. It was not part of this round. 🔒 **Separately, and not a contract row: the RETIRED ORACLE's scope is settled** — it covers the sibling `wasmrt` only; the eight other reference projects may be studied, and behavioural measurement of anything was never restricted. |
| **25** ⏳ | 2026-09-20 | 🚨 **TWO wazmrt DEFECTS THAT BROKE BINARY INTEROP IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, found by assembling the SPEC corpus with both toolchains and comparing bytes** (`ff856744`, Track B-a). **(1)** A block type that is a **non-null abstract ref** was emitted as wazmrt's INTERNAL enum tag — `(ref any)` is `0x64 0x6E` and wazmrt wrote `0x66`, which is not a wire encoding of anything. Our decoder read it back happily; **the sibling refused those bytes outright** (*"decode failed: unsupported instruction opcode"*), so wazmrt was producing modules no other runtime could load. **(2)** `any.convert_extern` and `extern.convert_any` had their **wire bytes swapped** in four places that all agreed — encoder table, decoder, doc comments, and `validate.zig`'s own switch on the raw byte. ⚠️ **That one was wrong in BOTH directions**: modules wazmrt assembled were refused by every other runtime, and correctly-encoded modules from any other toolchain were refused **here**. Fail-closed each way, which is why nothing noticed. 📌 **Neither is a contract ROW** — §0 keeps internal design out of scope and neither is a CLI or security surface — **but both are recorded, because they are exactly the class §3.1 exists to protect: bytes that must mean the same thing to both runtimes.** 📊 Spec-corpus byte agreement went 1,807 → **2,121 of 2,141**; the residual 20 are two legal shorthand choices, cross-decoded on both runtimes with both encodings and documented at `roadmap.md` → B-a. ✅ **The real-world `.wat` parity claim is UNCHANGED at 954/954** — none of these constructs occurs there, which is precisely why that corpus could not find them. 🛠️ The check is committed as `tools/emitter-diff.mjs`, optional and outward-reaching like the Bake Off. |
| **24** ⏳ | 2026-09-20 | ✅ **§2.1 — THE SUBCOMMAND SPELLINGS ARE IN, AND THE 2026-09-19 LIST IS NOW EMPTY** (`b35940cb`, Track B-c4). `wazmrt run <module> <export> [args…]`, `wasi [flags] <module> [-- argv]`, `wat <file.wat> [-o out]`, `wast <file\|dir>… [-v]` — all four **additive**, with every bare-path form verified unchanged, so a command line written for either runtime now runs on both. 🔑 **`run` and `wasi` are aliases onto the EXISTING paths**, not copies: they set a mode and move the argument index, and everything after is parsed by the same code, so the verify gate, `--features`, `--max-iterations` and Z1/Z2/Z3 apply identically whichever spelling was used. 🔒 **The named modes do NOT fall back** — `run m.wasm nosuch` on a module that also exports `_start` would otherwise run `_start` with `nosuch` as guest argv and exit 0, which is §2.3's failure in a new position; the bare form's guard stays narrow because there the word really might be argv. 🆕 **`wat` closes §2.1's *"wazmrt must grow it"* row**; measured from the sibling rather than assumed, it writes **nothing** without `-o` and only reports the size. ⚠️⚠️ **The one real trap, recorded because it is fail-OPEN:** `wasi`'s leading flags are moved behind the path as `lead ++ tail` — `tail ++ lead` would place them after an explicit `--`, handing `--dir` to the guest as argv so the run proceeds **with no preopen and no message**. It is a named function with its own inversion-proven test, and confirmed end to end. 🧹 Also fixed: the unknown-flag hint advised *"use `--` to pass it to the guest"* from `.wast`, summarize, `wat` and `run`, none of which have guest argv — a §2.5-class untruth in a diagnostic, now per-mode. 📏 exe +9,216, **lib +0, dll +0** — none of this is in `root.zig`, so CLI convergence costs the embed artifacts nothing. ⏳ **wasmrt's copy is still at 10 — PENDING MIRROR**, and §2.1's `pin` row remains wasmrt's half. |
| **23** ⏳ | 2026-09-20 | ✅ **B-d IS FIXED and the two pin listings are now IDENTICAL IN LENGTH — 1,467 lines each** (`35d8aa4b`). `(type N)` naming a type the module has not declared yet is checked against the **finished** type space instead of an empty one, so `bindgen_fixtures/fnany_50.wat` and `hostfn_50.wat` are refused here exactly as wasmrt refuses them, with a dedicated `InlineTypeUseMismatch` rather than a generic *"bad module field"*. 📊 **Cross-runtime parity is therefore total: `.wat` 954 of 954, `.wasm` 513 of 513, nothing in one listing and not the other.** 🔑 The cause was time-of-check, not a missing check: the text format's type index space is the declared `(type …)` defs *plus* every implicitly interned signature, appended as they are met, so a check run where the typeuse is parsed can be looking at an empty space — it skipped itself and deferred to a downstream verdict the emitter then prevented from ever arriving. ⚠️ **The fix is "ask later", NOT "refuse a forward reference"**: a forward `(type N)` whose inline signature *agrees* with what lands at N is legal and wasm-tools assembles it, so that case is pinned by its own assertion — a blanket refusal would have passed every failing case and broken the legal one. 🔒 **The out-of-range hand-off is kept and is now truthful** — wasm-tools assembles `(func (type 5))` in a module with no types and **both** runtimes refuse those bytes at decode, verified by running both. ⬜ **Still open on wazmrt: the four subcommand spellings (§2.1)** — Track B-c4, and it is the last row of the 2026-09-19 measurement. |
| **22** ⏳ | 2026-09-20 | ✅ **Z4 IS CLOSED — `.wat` pin digests are PORTABLE** (`1bfdc6f5`, §3.1m-r). Re-measured with the same command on the same tree, the sibling rebuilt from its committed `ff99f6f1` (was `ab13ba975`) into a scratch target: **954 of 954 comparable `.wat` files agree, up from 2; 0 differ.** 🔑 **The v17 annex named ONE cause and there were THREE**, and the other two were reachable only by the gate — `mathlib.wat`, the file the byte-for-byte diagnosis was run on, has neither an unused data segment nor a tag, so neither could appear in it. 🎓 *A single-file confirmation proves the cause it finds and says nothing about the ones it cannot reach.* **(1)** the `name` section was never emitted — twelve subsections now are, with the shape **read off a wasm-tools-assembled module** rather than recalled, and label entries keyed by the block's **ordinal in the body** (counting unnamed blocks), never by stack depth; **(2)** the data-count section was emitted for **every** module with a data section — legal, and 3 bytes no other assembler writes — now emitted exactly when a body names a segment, per §5.5.16; **(3)** an imported function's implicit type was interned **after** every tag's, because tags intern during the field loop and imports interned in a pass after it — now interned at the import, in source order alongside the tags, with defined functions still a later pass, which is what wasm-tools does. ⚠️ **§3.1's operator note inverts: `.wat` pins no longer have to be made per runtime.** 🚨 **AND A NEW wazmrt DEFECT THE RUN FOUND (B-d), which is why the count is 954 and not 956:** `(type N)` naming an undeclared type in an import's typeuse is refused by wasmrt and **silently mis-bound by wazmrt** — `__host_print`, written `(param i32 i32)`, is emitted as `(param i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32)`, rc 0. `checkInlineTypeUse` skips itself when the index is not interned *yet* and defers to a downstream verdict the emitter then prevents. **A §2.5-class failure and wazmrt's to fix.** ⬜ **Still open on wazmrt: the four subcommand spellings (§2.1)** — Track B-c4. |
| **21** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | ✅ **wazmrt ADOPTS: Z1, Z2, Z3, the `--dir` fix, the pin DB order + warning, and wasm-tools' feature vocabulary** (`f780ad27`, `3fb36c7a`). Z1 fails with rc 1 naming the export; Z2 says `unknown flag` in every host position with no path-guessing, and leaves guest positions alone; Z3's header is neutral. §2.2's `--dir` is fixed per the owner's §5 #10 ruling — a drive letter is **exactly one ASCII letter at the start**, so `.:/` splits and `C:\tmp` does not, and `::` is accepted. §3.3's lookup is shared-path → own-path → **warn when the sibling's DB exists and ours does not**, as a pure function with all eight combinations tested. §2.2's `--features` resolves wasm-tools' whole vocabulary. 🚨 **AND A SECURITY DEFECT FOUND WHILE DOING IT, recorded because it is a contract-surface failure: `--allow-symlink` was missing from the shared flag list, so `wazmrt start.wasm --allow-symlink --verify enforce` RAN AN UNVERIFIED MODULE, rc 0**, where the same line without it correctly refuses. The flag region ended at it and every later host flag went unseen — `--max-iterations` dropped too. 🎓 *The "one list, because a second copy would drift" comment sat directly above that list; the list was in one place and the parser was reading a different vocabulary.* ⬜ **Still open on wazmrt: Z4 (§3.1m) and the subcommand spellings (§2.1)** — Track B-c2 and B-c4. |
| **20** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | ✅ **§2.1/§2.2 — wasmrt's COLUMN IS GREEN (T9e); wazmrt's halves are what remain.** Verified by building wasmrt's committed code into the pen-holder's own scratch target (nothing written to their tree, §1a) and running it: bare `<module> <export>` returns **5**, `.wast` by extension, `pin <file>`, **both `--dir` separators**, and **both feature vocabularies**. 🎯 **F1 IS CLOSED** — measured live earlier in this same session, fixed hours later. ⏳ **Outstanding on wazmrt:** the four subcommand spellings (all → `cannot read 'run'`), `::`, the hyphenated feature vocabulary (`bulk-memory-operations` → `unknown proposal`), and Z1–Z4. ⚠️⚠️ **NEW DEFECT FOUND BY THIS PASS — §2.2z: `--dir .:/` DOES NOT WORK ON wazmrt, and it is the example wazmrt's own `--help` prints.** The split guard is `i > 1` (a Windows drive-letter guard), so a **one-character relative host path** is indistinguishable from a drive letter and is never split; `./:/` works, `.:/` does not. 🎓 **Three things at once:** a live defect, a §2.2 claim carried since v1 that was **written from reading and never run** (the fourth such error across the two projects), and 🔒 **§5 #10 made concrete** — the "looks like a drive letter" heuristic giving a wrong answer on ordinary input. ⚠️ **Adding `::` alone would not fix it.** 📌 **`multi_table` recorded as an OBSERVATION, not a row** — §0 puts engine modelling out of scope — but the observable consequence is stated: the same `--features` line does not gate the same thing on both. **REOPEN** when one accepts a module the other refuses on that basis. |
| **19** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | ✅ **§3.7a IS CLOSED — wasmrt implements the execution bound (T9i), and this closes §5 decision #5.** Re-verified by the pen-holder by RUNNING both on the same bytes at `--max-iterations 1000000`: `(loop (br 0))` and `(func $f (return_call $f))` **both trap on both runtimes**, rc 1, each message naming the ceiling and how to raise it. The differential table that opened the section — wazmrt trapping, wasmrt hanging — is green in every cell. 🔬 **wasmrt re-measured the default on its own corpus** rather than adopting it: green at `1<<20`, `return_call`/`return_call_ref` failing at `1<<19`, 36 failures at `1<<14` — **the same shape as wazmrt's descent**, so `1<<30` is a measured default on both rather than a shared guess. ⚠️ **The C ABI takes `0` as "leave the default", not "unlimited"** — an embedder must not disarm a ceiling with a zero, while a person at a terminal may. **Recommended, not binding** (§0 keeps the C ABI out of scope); if wazmrt picks the other convention it must be **documented**. 🎓 **A lesson that sharpens §4 check 6:** the pen-holder's first run put the flag in a guest position, it never applied, and the run exited **1** from an argument-count error — **an `rc != 0` assertion would have called that the bound working.** Assert the trap. |
| **18** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | 🔒 **OWNER: THE PIN DB PATH IS DECIDED — §3.3, and §5 decision #1 CLOSES.** `/etc/wasmtk/pins` · `C:\ProgramData\wasmtk\pins`, named for the deployment both runtimes ship inside, **each runtime's own path kept as a fallback**, and 🔒 **a loud warning when a runtime finds no DB where its sibling would have found one** instead of quietly computing `armed = false`. ✅ wasmrt implements exactly that (T9e) as a pure function with a mutation-verified test. 🎓 **This was the most dangerous unresolved row in the file since v1, and what closes it is the WARNING, not the path.** A shared path alone still fails silently during a part-migrated deployment — the binary swaps, the DB sits at the sibling's old path, and `armed = false` is an ordinary state with no error attached. *The failure mode was never "no DB"; it was "no DB, and no reason to think that is wrong."* ⏳ **wazmrt to adopt the order AND the warning AND a test that the warning fires** — ⚠️ **adopting only the path is the dangerous partial fix**, closing the both-new case and leaving the migration window, which is the window an operator is actually in. Track B-b. |
| **17** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | ⚠️⚠️ **Z4 — `.wat` PIN DIGESTS ARE NOT PORTABLE BETWEEN THE TWO RUNTIMES, and it is wazmrt's to fix.** §3a said to make the `.wat` agreement a **test** rather than an assumption; run, it fails. wasmrt measured 2 agree / 529 differ over 535 files; 🔬 **the pen-holder re-ran it over the whole 959-file `wasmtk` tree and got the same shape: 2 agree, 952 differ.** ✅ **The diagnosis is confirmed byte-for-byte, not taken on trust:** wasmrt's assembled `mathlib.wat` hashes to its own pin digest, and the same bytes under `wasm-tools strip --all` hash to **wazmrt's pin digest exactly**; `objdump` shows the sole difference is a 2020-byte `custom "name"` section. 🎯 **The exceptions prove the mechanism — the only two files of 959 that agree are the only two with zero `$identifiers`**, so there are no names to emit and no section to differ by. 🔒 **It fails CLOSED** (a `.wat` pinned under one runtime is *refused* under the other), so it is an operational break, not a hole — **but only `.wasm` pins are portable until it is fixed**, and an installer pinning `.wat` must pin per runtime. 📬 **The ask: emit the `name` section from the identifiers the text carries**, as wasm-tools and wasmtime do — 🔒 which also matches the owner's standing direction **not to discard information the source carries**. ⚠️ **Z4 is not "match wasmrt's bytes"; it is "stop throwing the names away"** — the digests converging is the test, not the goal. Track B-b. |
| **16** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | 🔒 **OWNER: A FLAG WITH A REQUIRED POSITION, WRITTEN WHERE IT CANNOT APPLY, IS AN ERROR — §2.4b.** *"we need an error thrown when it is in the wrong location."* The flag must also state its position in the **usage/invocation** section, not only in its own entry — *a constraint documented only where the reader already knows to look is not documented.* ⚠️⚠️ **Found a live fail-OPEN defect in wazmrt, which is why this is a contract row and not a help-text fix:** `wazmrt m.wasm --features mvp` exited **0** having run under the **FULL feature set**, silently. `--features` is the one flag whose entire job is to REFUSE modules, so a user asking for a smaller trusted computing base got everything enabled with no error, no warning and a success status. 🎓 **It fell between the two mechanisms built to prevent exactly this:** `flagRegion` deliberately excludes `--features` (so a guest's own `--features mvp` can never narrow the language), and zH7 warns only for names in those same lists — *a rule that names the things it guards will not guard the thing it does not name.* ✅ **Shipped in wazmrt** (`misplacedFeaturesFlag`), two tests, inversion-proven, suite green at 767. ✅ **wasmrt is not in breach** — it has no CLI `--features` yet; the row binds it when it adds one. 🆕 **§4 gains check 11**, written to assert the **exit status** rather than the message, because the fault being guarded is a *successful* run that ignored the flag. |
| **15** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | 🔒 **OWNER NARROWS §2.4a THE SAME DAY IT WAS WRITTEN — after the module path, a SINGLE DASH is the guest's.** Position 3 now splits by **dash count**: an unknown **`--flag`** errors; a **`-flag`** is guest argv and needs no `--`, so `prog.wasm -la` runs. 🎯 **The reasoning is a closed enumeration, not a preference:** *every* host flag legal after the path is double-dash (`--dir`, `--ro-dir`, `--env`, `--max-*`, `--pins`, `--verify`, `--no-verify`, `--yes`, `--features`, `--allow-symlink`); the single-dash names `-h`/`-v` are first-argument-only (§2.4); and the subcommand flags (`wast -v`, `wat -o`) live in modes with **no guest argv**. So a single-dash token there **cannot be a host flag** — nothing to disambiguate. ⚠️ **The cost is recorded, not smoothed over:** a mistyped `-dir /tmp` now reaches the guest silently. 🔒 **The owner was offered a "looks like a host flag" warning for precisely that case and refused it**, which is the same decision as v14 arriving from the other direction — *a near-miss list is itself a thing that would drift between two runtimes.* ✅ **The narrowing REMOVES work from wazmrt rather than adding it:** passing `-la` to the guest is what wazmrt already does, and pre-narrowing v11 would have had us break it. 🚨 **§1c HAPPENED AGAIN, DURING THIS PASS, AND IT IS THE REASON THIS ROW IS SEPARATE FROM v11.** wasmrt's session recorded the narrowing in its copy while this session was folding the **pre-narrowing** text in as v11 — two sessions, one hour, each correctly editing only its own copy (§1a held; nothing was destroyed this time). 🎓 **§1a fixed the destructive half of the collision and did nothing about the wasted half**, which is what §1c predicted and what §5 #7 proposes to close. v11 is left standing and amended here rather than rewritten: **their copy already records that wazmrt folded in the wide text as v11**, so editing v11 in place would make the two histories disagree about what happened. |
| **14** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | 🔒🔒 **OWNER: NO "LOOKS LIKE" — §2.4a-i.** *"improper cli options should throw an error. We should have no 'looks like' built in so that it interprets a cli. If it is a valid cli option run it, if not throw and error."* **The general rule that v11/§2.4a is one instance of.** In a host-flag position an argument is **exact-matched or rejected**: no path-guessing, no fuzzy/"did you mean" adoption, no prefix abbreviation, no "probably the guest's" inference. 🎯 **Its first casualty is a message, not a behaviour:** wazmrt's `--bogus m.wasm` already exits 1, but says *"cannot read '--bogus': FileNotFound"* — **right code, and it sends the user to the filesystem to debug a typo'd flag.** v11 had logged that as "the wording"; v14 makes it a breach of a rule. ⚠⚠ **GRAMMAR IS NOT RESEMBLANCE, and that distinction is what makes v14 implementable** — the host/guest boundary (`--`, and the first non-flag argument after the path) is fixed by the shape of the line, not by judging arguments, so a guest's argv is not "an option wazmrt failed to recognise". Without that carve-out `prog.wasm install --yes` could not be written, and §2.4 records what that costs. ⚠️ **TWO TENSIONS RAISED, NEITHER DECIDED HERE:** §5 **#10** — §2.2's `--dir` drive-letter fallback is itself a resemblance rule, **the one heuristic this contract has AGREED to**, and it is a flag *value* rather than a flag *name*; §5 **#11** — whether zH7's warn should become an error. 🎓 *The pen-holder does not get to repeal an agreed row by implication, and a new general rule is exactly the moment that temptation arrives.* |
| **13** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | 📎→📒 **wasmrt's §2.3m ANNEX FOLDED IN by the pen-holder (wazmrt, regime A).** Two rows change. 🆕 **§2.3 gains the Z1 row** — naming an export the module does not have is a **failure**, never a silent fall-back to summarizing — and it is written as binding on **BOTH** sides, because on the day it was folded in **neither was clean**: `wazmrt m.wasm nosuch` → rc 0, and so does `wasmrt m.wasm nosuch` (**F1**, re-verified here, still live; wasmrt's compliance is via its `run` subcommand only). ✅ **§2.3 row 3 promoted ⬜ → AGREED**: every host-side failure and every trap → `1` on both, `proc_exit(n)` → `n & 0xff`, measured twice — wasmrt's 18-row matrix and the pen-holder's own 12-case re-run on the same bytes. **That closes §5 decision #4 with no per-kind table**, because neither implementation distinguishes kinds. 🆕 **§4 gains checks 8, 9 and 10**, one per new rule, each written so the *vacuous* pass is impossible: check 9 greps the output because the exit code was already right when Z3 was found, and check 10 runs every call form because a one-form check would have called wasmrt compliant. 🔎 **The re-run also narrowed Z1**: `wazmrt invalid.wasm bad` already exits 1, so the dropped export name is specific to a module that **validates** — the run where nothing else went wrong is the one that silently does the wrong thing. |
| **12** ⏳ | 2026-09-19 | 🔒 **OWNER DECISION FOLDED IN AND NUMBERED — §2.5, a validity claim in the output must match the verdict (Z3).** Owner: *"we also need a contract item for Z3"*. No line a command prints may call a module **valid** unless it validated; a summary printed before validation finishes must use neutral wording. ⚠️ **This carves the ONE exception into §0's "output text is out of scope"**, and the carve-out is the load-bearing part: *a validity claim is not style, it is a verdict a human reads*, and §0 would otherwise have made Z3 unfixable by construction. Everything else a command prints stays out of scope. **wasmrt complies** (`invalid.wasm: WebAssembly module (version 1)`), pinned by `cli_exit_codes.rs::the_summary_never_calls_an_invalid_module_valid`, mutation-verified against wazmrt's own header wording. ⚠️ **wazmrt is in breach and its exit code is RIGHT** — `invalid.wasm: valid wasm v1, 5 section(s)` … `validation: FAILED`, rc 1 — which is precisely why this needed a row: **every gate wazmrt owns was already green on it.** Tracked at Track B-b. |

The row stands as the record of what was folded in; **§2.4a's text is the narrowed rule.** **Complementary to zH7, not a replacement** — a *known* host flag stranded in a guest position still only **warns** (it may be the guest's own); an *unknown* one in a host position **errors**. wasmrt complies in all four host positions (re-verified by running it), pinned by `cli_unknown_flag.rs`. ⚠⚠ **wazmrt is in breach in three of four**: rc 0 after the path, rc 0 in `.wast`, and rc 1 for the wrong reason (*"cannot read '--bogus'"*) before it.

That claim had been carried as ⚠⚠ since v1 and was written from reading the code. **F5: `-v` output shape differs** (1 line vs 2). ⚠ Everything check 5 did not reach — the `.wast` row, `--ro-dir`, `--allow-symlink`, `--env`, the ceiling flags, `--`, and all of §2.3’s per-failure exit codes — stays ⬜ UNVERIFIED and **may not be quoted as agreed.** |
| **10** | 2026-08-19 | 🆕 **wazmrt WARNS on a misplaced flag (§2.2 position row) — zH7, and F3 is what found it.** wazmrt recognises host flags only in the LEADING run after the module path; the inverse of that protection had never been asked, so a flag written after a guest argument was **silently donated to the guest and never applied**. Fail-closed for `--no-verify`/`--dir`, ⚠️ **fail-OPEN for `--verify`, `--pins` and every `--max-*`** — a user asks for a restriction, gets no error, and runs without it. Now warns (never refuses: a guest may legitimately take `--dir` as its own argument), and **nothing after an explicit `--` is examined**. Zero bytes. 🎓 Demonstrated with `--max-iterations`, a flag wazmrt had added HOURS earlier in the same track — *a change's own new surface is the one place the audit that produced it will not look.* |

Corrected in place and downgraded ⚠️⚠️ → ⚠️: the divergence is real, its consequence is a **clean failure**, not a silent mis-preopen. 🎓 **A refuted claim left in the table is what the next reader quotes** — an annex records the finding, the table is what gets believed, so folding is the pen-holder's actual job.

Current application: wazmrt finishes **Track H**, then holds for wasmrt. |
| **7** ⏳ | 2026-08-19 | ✅ **ROW 3b's 🚩 IS DISCHARGED — §0.5 restored, from wazmrt's session context, the only place it survived.** ⚠️ **Restored as §1b, NOT as a verbatim §0.5:** three of its four parts had since been re-expressed better (the order in §1; the editing boundary in §1a, which the owner has since made ABSOLUTE and is stronger than what §0.5 introduced), so re-pasting it would have left two definitions of one order in one file — the exact drift this file exists to prevent. What was genuinely lost and is now back: **the ordered checklist** (including *"the sibling may cite a contract row that does not exist yet — that is a cue to WRITE the row"*, which is literally what T9i did), and *"`coordinate` is also the right response to discovering you have already diverged."* Adds **§1c** on wasmrt's diagnosis — *a version is a pin, not a lock* — plus owner rows 6 (the `c9c447f3` (was `7ce0dcd2`) attribution, which wazmrt cannot fix without breaching §1a) and 7 (one coordination session at a time). |
| **6** ⏳ | 2026-08-19 | 🔒🔒 **THE EDITING BOUNDARY IS NOW ABSOLUTE (owner) — §1a.** *"Not to edit the other's md file unless specifically directed by me … each project needs to edit their own files … important for tracking and integrity."* **Neither project writes ANYTHING into the other's tree — including this file** — without a specific owner direction. `coordinate` is an order to CONFER, never a licence to WRITE. Supersedes the earlier "this file is the one thing you may write there" rule, which caused two destructive overwrites in one day (rows 3b, 4). Rule 1 rewritten: propose in your OWN copy, bump the version, mark ⏳ **PENDING MIRROR**, and TELL THE OWNER the sibling is behind — the owner directs the other project, which makes the edit in its own tree. A version mismatch is now a normal coordination signal, resolved by reporting, **never** by copying over it. ⚠️ **This row is itself pending mirror: wasmrt's copy is at 5.** |
| **5** | 2026-08-19 | wazmrt ran the **A/B/A throughput** measurement wasmrt's T9i plan called for (§3.7a): the tick costs **~3% on a tight loop** — 34.29 → 33.45 → 34.62 ns/loop-iter, A-to-A spread ~1%, B a single sample. Recorded for wasmrt's planning, **not** as a contract row (§0 puts performance out of scope). ⚠️ Names the one performance response that WOULD be a contract change: amortizing the tick to every *N*th back-edge alters the UNIT's granularity, so the ceiling would stop meaning the same thing on both sides. |
| **4** | 2026-08-19 | 🔒 **The EDITING BOUNDARY added to §1** (reconstructed from row 3’s description, since the §0.5 it named was destroyed): this file is the only thing either project may write into the other’s tree, and ⚠⚠ **read the other copy before overwriting it** — it starts untracked in both repos, so a blind copy is unrecoverable. §2’s owner ruling restored. The duplicate row-3 entries reconciled into 3 + 3b. |
| **3b** | 2026-08-19 | ⚠️⚠️ **A CONCURRENT-EDIT COLLISION, recorded rather than tidied away — the drift hazard §1 predicts, arriving on day one.** Both projects edited this file at once. wazmrt's §3.7a rewrite (better than what it replaced: it had *built* the feature and found that **the UNIT matters more than the number**) landed in wasmrt's tree mid-session and was committed there without being noticed; in the other direction, wasmrt `cp`-ed its copy over wazmrt's **untracked** working copy without checking it first, destroying wazmrt's in-flight **§0.5** — which row 3 below still references and which is **NOT PRESENT in either copy**. 🚩 **wazmrt must restore §0.5 from its own context; nobody else has it.** Restored here: the §2 owner ruling, dropped in the same collision. **Two lessons, both already in the rulebooks:** *a version is a pin, not a lock — it makes drift detectable, it does not prevent a simultaneous write*, and **check before you overwrite**, which is exactly the editing boundary row 3 was adding. ✅ **The 🚩 IS DISCHARGED — §0.5 was restored from wazmrt's session context as §1b; see row 7.** |
| **3** | 2026-08-19 | 🔑 **`coordinate` — the one-word binding order (§0.5), owner.** One word from the owner now obliges the full cross-project protocol: byte-compare both copies, read the sibling's **uncommitted** in-flight work, diff shipped behaviour against every in-scope row, **verify by RUNNING both on the same bytes**, land changes in both copies with a version bump, and report divergences with reopen conditions. Carries **the editing boundary** — this file is the only thing either project may write into the other's tree, and the sibling's own `cmem/` stays theirs. |
| **2** | 2026-08-19 | **The execution bound (§3.7a).** Owner decided a bound is wanted; §5 decision #3 closes. wazmrt shipped `--max-iterations` + `IterationLimitExceeded` (default `1<<30`) in its Track zH3 — ⚠️ **before this file carried it, which §1 rule 1 forbids; recorded as a process breach rather than tidied away.** New rows: the flag in §2.2; the agreed design in §3.7a, whose load-bearing clause is **the UNIT** (one loop back-edge **or** one tail-call hop) — equal defaults with different units are not swappable; differential checks 6 and 7. **Verified by running both on the same wasmrt-assembled bytes: wazmrt traps on both shapes, wasmrt hangs on both.** Status ⚠️ DIVERGENT AND LIVE until wasmrt lands it. |
| **1** | 2026-08-19 | Opened. Scope set by the owner (CLI options + security checks; C ABI explicitly out). Recorded: the `--dir` separator break and the bare-path-executes consequence, both live today; the pin DB path risk; the nine-row `decide()` matrix; the ceiling defaults, verified equal in both; the WASI rights rows already agreed. |
